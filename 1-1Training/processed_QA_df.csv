156,68849,how do you remove glass shower doors and railings on a bath tub  i need to remove the two sliding glass doors  they ride on wheels on the top  and  if possible  the metal railings on the top bottom  and sides  i have noticed the railings and support bars have a gummy glue like substance  which i assume is to help seal it and keep it in place this is to make it easier to give my baby a bath in the tub  i don t need the doors for now any advice is appreciated  thanks ,the glass doors ride on wheels in a track on the top rails  they are removed typically by holding onto the door and then lifting the wheels out of the track and the doors come off  sometimes they are just riding in a track and you can lift them straight up and out  and sometimes there are smaller holes in the track that you have to line the wheels up with in order to get them out  if you take off the doors you might not have to take off the rails if it is ok with the rails in place  and then you can put the doors back when the baby grows up  once you take the doors off then you can see how the rails are affixed to the tub wall  typically there will be screws on the end of the rail that extend into the wall  typically the bottom rail isn t screwed into the tub   take the screws out  the top rail should come off pretty much when you take out the screws  the bottom rail also has silicone sealant on it  you can carefully cut away the biggest parts of the silicone to get the bottom rail off  then you can carefully scrape off the remaining silicone hope this helps  all in all not a difficult job  although tedious getting the silicone sealant off

197,56729,how to set tile  ,i f you take your time and are particular to make a good job tiling is remarkably easy  just remember to tack a level wooden batten to the wall for your first tile to sit on and then when the wall is tiled remove the batten and tile in the space below  the reason for this is that no room is square and it looks really bad if you end up with a sliver of tile or a gap filled with grout  so always space your tiles first see how it looks and then start with a half tile on the horizontal and vertical  never ever start with a full tile  as if you start with a half you can make your tiles go bigger and smaller with the wall  try to make sure that where the tile edges meet each other they are fairly level  if they are not just pull the tile out where necessary  and not dipping in or proud of each other as you dont want any brown edges of the tiles showing through the grout having said that grouting hides a multitude of sins clean off any adhesive as soon as possible  take special care and after a day grout it  only do small sections at a time say two foot square as grout sets quick on a dry joint  when you have grouted a small area then take a grouting tool or the round end of a pencil will do and rub the joints  clean with a almost dry sponge then rub joints again filling in any pin holes then clean again  repeat for the rest of the wall  if the wall is very bad  before you tile you could always level the wall with plasterboard or some waterproof equivalent  always use waterproof adhesive and grout    im not a tiler i am a plasterer but recently have been doing a fair bit of tiling and although a little slow and fussy i have been delighted with the results its much easier than you might think

213,62862,how do i stop water from seeping into my basement  ,there are two typical non utility sources 1  the ground around your house does not shed water away from the foundation 2  the groundwater table is high i have found that most instances the problem is the first one   usually the least expensive method to be re grading the yard to keep water away from the house   occasionally you may need to excavate to the foundation slab  and apply a good waterproofing such as an asphalt compound  customarily  home builders throw trash  such as lunch litter and wood scraps  along the foundation walls before the backfill is placed   in addition to natural settlement of the ground around a home  when the trash decays  or collapses  the ground settles further   when gutters overflow  this area holds water which can easily get inside unless the walls were waterproofed to swimmingpool standards i recommend pulling back the top 4 6  of soil from around the house by as much as 6   8 feet out   get some clay soil and place a wedge of it with the thickest part near the house  pack the clay down good  then re grade the top soil back  and plant  the end result will be that the ground around the foundation is higher than the remainder of the yard   it will also be important to have the yard graded to get positive drainage moving the rainwater further away  a landscape architect can help you with this   then be sure to get the down spouts pointed away from the house

229,127954,how to troubleshoot the  1 hp jet pump   hi  i ve been using a 1 hp jet pump for the past 7 years for lifting water from the shallow well to the overhead tank i ve been experiencing lot of problems due to the excessive hardness of the well water   my motor strucks many times but this time it is not the problem due to hardness of water my pump does not starts very often for example  if i put this evening it works but the next day it is not starting at all   when i checked the capacitor keltron 12 5 mfd 440vac 50 hz  it is ok   the coil is not burnt this time i didn t want to spend more for the technician   removed the capacitor myself    checked   refixed it to my surprise it worked for 3days   again the pump is not running there is no jam in the impeller  again i did the same thing as i did before but the pump is not running my question is what will be the other reasons for the pump not running if capacitor is good   the coil is not burnt   there is no jam in the impeller ,man  these kinds of intermittent problems can be so frustrating   i like it better when things break and stay broken   at least you know if you do something and it works  the thing you did fixed the problem  and it didn t just fix itself anyway is the motor sitting outside or somewhere that the temperature varies a lot from day to night i used to work at a lab where a lot of equipment was in sheds where the air was just the same as the outside temperature   sometimes these things would malfunction only at night or only during the daytime   it was because the circuitry was thermally cycled for a long time  and the variations in temperatures makes the circuit components expand and contract   that repeated expansion and contraction can cause the solder joints and wires to weaken where they are under mechanical stress  and sometimes crack these cracks can be very hard to track down  because they are so small and because the problem is intermittent   so maybe you have the same problem where you leave it outside overnight and the circuit cools and contracts  opening up the connection   then it doesn t start until it warms up again and you get in there and wiggle it around if i were you i would get in there with a multimeter and check to make sure that your connections are still good   i suspect something is loose and when you take the cap out to check it  you wiggle whatever the loose thing is   it could be a problem with one of the capacitor leads if messing with the cap fixed it also  you may already know this  but a 440v 12mf capacitor can store quite a bit of energy   even if you unplug the motor when you work on it  the capacitor can still give you a very serious electric shock  particularly if you have wet hands or even damp skin  which you might if you are messing with a water pump   so make sure to discharge the cap by making electrical contact between the two terminals with a bleeder resistor  before you touch anything  and let it discharge for a while   a capacitor that size can be pretty dangerous good luck

251,105502,how can i get a toilet unclogged  we have tried using a plunger and nothing it working   it flushed but now it is just overflowing   thanks ,how to unclog a toiletunclogging a toilet is not exactly the most entertaining way to spend a day  but it s something we all have to face at one point or another in our lives  when you re renting a place  the worst case scenerio is that you have to have maintenance come and fix your clog  but when you re a homeowner  you definitely want to avoid having a plumber come over so  after several days of battling toilets in my house and searching the web for unique techniques  here are my three ping certified recommended steps to unclogging your toilet  plunge    first  you obviously want to use your plunger to try and loosen any clogs  start by making a seal over the hole in the bowl with the plunger  push down slowly and pull back quickly  start by doing this at a slow pace and then working up speed  use a toilet snake auger    i dislike this step because it can scrape the porcelein  but it s necessary if the plunger doesn t do the job  make sure you get a toilet snake auger  as a sink snake auger will scrape the porcelein on your toilet  trust me  work the snake as far back into the hole as possible  trying to dislodge any tissue or solid matter  mmmm    tasty   pour a bucket of water    if the snake still doesn t let you flush the toilet successfully  this is what finally did it for me  this step can also be used before the plunger in the case of a very small clog  but works well as a last step with a stubborn clog  get a normal sized bucket and fill it between 1 8 and 1 4 of the way full with warm water  when the water in the toilet is at its lowest point  usually with clogged toilets  very little water is left in the bottom   pour the water directly into the hole in the bowl from about waist high  the pressure of the water being poured into the bowl does a surprisingly good job at disloding the remaining clog  you may need to repeat this step once or twice

959,93908,how do you change oil  ,start with gathering some information  from your owner manual or perhaps asking at the parts store you need to know what grade and quantity of oil you need  such as 5 quarts of 5w30 motor oil   for some cars  like vw s  mercedes and bmw s  there may be some special oil specifications your new oil must meet  so make sure you are aware of those as well as the quantity also  make sure you learn if the capcity include the filter or not   if not  find out how much oil you must add when you change the filter   it s probably not more than 1 quart find out what filter you need finally  do you need a new crush washer for the drain plug   some cars have a crush washer that is supposed to be replaced during the oil change you will need to gather tools  such as an oil filter wrench as well as a drain pan for the oil and a wrench or socket set for the oil oh  cheap kitty litter is good for soaking up any spilled oil if you should miss the drain pan you will need rags to wipe your hands and a clean rag to check the oil   you will probably also need a funnel and perhaps ramps or a jack and jackstands to raise the car   do not work on the car sitting on a jack only  use jackstands take a drive  getting the car warm and then return to where you are going to change the oil and raise the car   driving to the parts store to get any items you need and returning should be sufficient once you have the car up  locate the drain plug on the oil pan   the oil pan should be at the bottom of the engine  if you cannot tell the engine from any other part  quit now  this is not a job for you being careful  since the oil could be close to 200f  place the oil pan beneath the drain plug  allowing some room for the oil to shoot out from the drain   it may go as much as a foot or so from the opening  so plan accordingly carefully remove the drain plug from the pan   it s a good idea to wear gloves  so you don t get burned by the hot oil hang on to the drain plug  or you ll be fishing it out of the drain pan remove the filler cap  it will help the crankcase drain go have a beverage  call a friend  surf the web a while  give your car 10 15 minutes to drain most of the oil now  return the drain plug when the oil is finished draining   if you need a new crush washer  install it when you re install the drain plug move your drain pan under the oil filter   look at the new filter to see what shape and size this item is   your old one may be a different color and will certainly be dirty  so don t count on color helping you here i can often get them off with my bare hands  but if you need to  use the oil filter wrench to remove the old filter   drain the old filter into the pan you may want to take some time and wipe up any spilled oil from your car   when you remove the oil filter  you probably will spill oil on the car   just wipe it off to install the new oil filter you need two things  new clean oil and your hands   if your oil filter is vertical  with the opening at the top  it would be good to pre fill the filter with some oil   if your filter mounts sideways or the filter mounts with the opening facing down  don t worry  this is an optional nice touch put a small amount of clean oil on the gasket   make sure the old filter gasket is on the filter and not still on your engine   hand tighten the new filter   once the filter makes contact  tighten it 1 2 to 3 4 of an additional turn   it should say how far   hand tighten  too tight and you won t get it off again  or it will crush the gasket and leak now  fill the engine with the oil change quantity of oil at the filler cap   if this is the first time changing oil for this engine  i would not add the quantity specified for the filter until you can check the oil level   check the oil  if you can see new  clean oil on the dipstick  you probably have enough to start the car at this point   otherwis

997,120798,how do i hook up a three way switch  i have electric to both switches but the light won t turn on   i have changed the light bulb several times and that didn t help   i have also changed the receptacle and that didn t help ,installing 3 way switchesfrom apply now your guide to home repair you can turn the lights on here and off over there  and you can do it yourself once you know the trick  it s not exactly simple  but it s far less complicated than most people assume  there are two important things to remember to make 3 way switches work right  one is that the switches are really single pole  double throw devices  that means that one of the three terminals on each switch is always connected to one of the other two  the terminal that is always connected is called the point terminal  it should be specially identified  most commonly  the screw for the point terminal will be dark and the other two screws will be bright  toggling   flipping   a 3 way switch changes which of the other two terminals the point terminal is connected to  to help visualize this  you can think of a 3 way switch as a  v   the bottom of the v is the point terminal and the top of the letter is where the other two terminals are  each time the switch is flipped  the wire terminated on the point is disconnected from one of the other two terminal screws and connected to the other  the other important thing to remember is that 3 way switches come in pairs  it takes two of them  and only two  to make the system work  in addition  three way switching works because the two non point terminals on one of the 3 way switches are always connected directly to the two non point terminals on the other 3 way switch with a pair of wires called the travelers  a three conductor cable   with or without a ground wire   connects the two switches and carries the two travelers  the third insulated conductor in the three conductor cable is used as a hot wire or as a neutral  depending on which is needed  in every 3 way switch system  the ungrounded conductor from the panel   the  hot  wire   is connected to the point terminal on one of the two switches  the switch controlled  hot  wire  which connects the switch system to the first controlled light  is connected to the point terminal on the other switch  the grounded conductor   the neutral wire   is not switched  it is carried to the first light and connected there  there are three scenarios that cover more than 90  of all three way switch installations  one of these should work for you in a new installation  if you re troubleshooting existing wiring  one of these will most likely be what you are looking at  remember to turn the power off at the panel before starting  for a new installation  remember to use  12 awg  american wire gauge  wire on a 20 amp circuit  you can use  14 awg wire on a circuit protected at 15 amps

1680,79010,how do i change a lamp from 220 v to 110 v  i have purchased some beautiful crystal lamps in germany  but will need to change wiring and plugs when i return to the usa  i would appreciate information on what i need to buy and how accomplish this task ,as long as the power consumption of the fixture is not too high  like upto 200 watts  you just need to change the plug  the light bulbs to 110v type  and no need to change the wiring   normally  a 200 watt fixture running at 220v draws exactly 200 220 or less than 1 ampere   so  if you power your fixture to 200 watts at 110 volts  the current will be 200 110 which is less than 2 amperes   normally they use a  16 or  14 wires in the fixtures   so  i think that should be okay   summary   1  change plug to north american standard  2  change the light bulbs to 110v type    maybe you could get a lesser wattage to draw lesser current  3  optional  change wiring to  14 good luck

1697,37825,how do i not get cheated by a home contractor  ,i used to be a tin man   i know how to answer this   getting a number of estimates is a good idea  as the person above suggests however   knowing your own budget and the value of the service you desire in advance of getting estimates is the most powerful way to control the circumstances try these steps 1  make sure your contractor has a few jobs under his belt   its not that i want to dissuede a talented company from getting a start  but you need to know that they can complete a job   obviously the longer they have been around the better 2  naturally check their reputation out with the better business bureau  if you live in the u s  3  here is the strongest point know the value of the labor and materials you want to put into the project   here s how    in today s world you can take your sketches to any home depot  lowes and most high end consumer home improvement stores and get them to estimate the materials needed to go into your job lets say you are working on a new single car garage   altogether home depot estimates your cost for a 24 x 24 single car garage to be around  6500 00   that doesnt include getting the slab dug and poured or the labor to build it if you have three contractors come in with prices ranging from  12 000    25 000 and you know the materials would only cost  6500  first   you need to know what each one is giving you   and then start looking at why the high price is so high   if its high because they are giving you more  then have them re bid it without the extras   if its high for no other reason then they are trying to make too much money off of you      basically  if you know the materials and someone can help you figure out what the labor would cost  then you tell the contractor what you can afford and do not sway from it so here s how i do it know   i know i ve got a project to build that costs  5 000 in materials   i figure out that the labor is usually 2 3 of the estimate  so i do my own estimate  more of a guestimate sure  which comes out at  15 000   then i insure that i can afford that cost then i get the estimates   whoever has the best experience  best reputation and comes closest to my budgeted number is the contractor i would choose 4  do not close on your deal on the same day the salesman calls on you   there are some hardcore closers out there who might actually represent good companies  but are only out to line their own pockets with your money with a quick sale   the background language they use for a person who buys on the same day is a  mooch    which means you are an easy mark to jack up the price and get a financed sale the same night   mooches do not know what things cost   they don t know materials  they don t know labor and they will sign without reading the contract all the way through take a day to read all the proposals   make sure there is language in the contract that protects you the consumer if you do sign  don t forget   you have a three day right of recision   in most or all states of the us   meaning that the contract isn t even valid until 72 hours after you signed it some of the old school tin men i worked for used to  spike  the job   that means that even though the recision time wasn t up  they would pull a building permit and put it in the customers window to distract the customer from considering a contract cancellation watch for strange behaviors like that one more thing i remember from my experience if a salesman calls back to the main office having a  discussion  with the home office  it might be real   or   he is having a fake conversation  even if its a pretend one with his boss  where they talk about  saving you money  with some materials they have  left over    this is utter bullsh t   the price has already been jacked up and they are allowing you to feel a sense of false victory in  talki

1778,114735,how do  i recharge the air conditioner on my dodge pickup  ,i totally agree with  thefarmersson  in the above post   if an a c system requires recharging  that means that there is a leak in the system   a c systems are closed systems that should never need to have additional freon added   unfortunately  the parts stores that sell freon don t really stress that a proper diagnosis needs to be made prior to adding additional freon   make sure you have repaired the leak in the system prior to adding additional freon   assuming that you have already done so  you will need the following  a vacuum pump and preferably a set a of r134a gauges or r12 gauges depending on your year model   the purpose of using a vacuum pump is twofold   it helps get all of the moisture out of the system and by pulling a vacuum on the a c system  you can verify that your repair to the leak in the system is fixed   to verify that your repair worked  hook up your a c gauges to the service ports and proceed to operate your vacuum pump   after running the vacuum pump for 20 minutes  your low side a c gauge should indicate that the system is under about 30  of vacuum   shut off the vacuum pump   let the vehicle sit for about 20 minutes and then come back and check the status of your gauges   if the low side gauge returns to 0 psi  or  atmospheric pressure  it means that outside air entered your a c system and brought the pressure back up to atmosperic pressure  indicating a leak   if this occurs  there is no point to charging the system with more freon because it will just leak out  and you will have to go back to the drawing board and attempt to find another leak   however  if the gauges remains close to 25  to 30  of vacuum  the system is ready for charging   hook up a can of freon to the yellow charging line on your a c gauges   with the engine off  open up the charging port on the yellow charging line and then open the low side port on your a c gauges   this will allow freon to start flowing from the can into your car s a c system   once the freon stops flowing  turn on your truck s engine and a c system   the a c compressor should kick on and start sucking more freon from the charging can   if the compressor does not kick on  there is an electrical problem present  which would be a totally different subject   basically  after the compressor kicks on  continue charging more freon into the system through the low side of the a c gauges until your gauges indicate about 30 35psi on the low side and 200 250psi on the high side   if everything is working properly  you should experience a 40   45 degree a c vent outlet temperature   if this all sounds too complicated  i would reccommend taking the vehicle to a reputable technician in your town who has the proper equipment to do the job   i don t reccommend these quick charge kits that the parts stores sell because they do not include pressure gauges so you don t know if you over or undercharged your system   proper operating pressures are essential for proper operation

2216,57661,how do i re move axils from a fwd car  i want to take out the trany only,first you have to jack up the car and support it with jackstands remove the wheels and the center axle nuts  do this before removing the brake calipers so someone can hold the brake for you to get them loose   on some cars it is possible to leave the calipers and rotors onbut not all the time  next seperate the outer tie rod and ball joint and ush down on the a arm with a large pry bar to swing the strut out of the way  next pull the axle out of the spindle  it might have to be tapped with a hammer to break it loose  after it is out of the spindle you can try pulling the axle out of the transmission by yanking on it a couple of times but it generally wont be that easy you will have to get under the car with a pry bar and pry it loose from the tranny  be careful not to pry against the seal in the tranny  also transmission fluid might come pouring out of the tranny when the axle is removed so dont lay directly under it and have a drain pan ready  to remove the transmission you are probably going to have to take it out the bottom  at this stage you can remove the torque converter bolts  tranny mounts  exhaust  shift cables  wiring  speedometer cable if you have one  and bell housing bolts  then you can soosten the subframe bols on the engine side about half way out and with a floor jack support the tranny side of the frame and remove the sub frame bolts on that side  slowly let the subframe down about 6 inches and stop look at your motor and make sure that nothing is binding  if it looks like the transmission will slide out under the body you can then support the motor with a piece of wood running from one strut tower to the other and a strap from that piece of wood to the motor  i like to use a 4x4 for this because it is strong enough  after the motor has been supported you can let the subframe down more and pull the transmission up off of the subframe and out from under the car  also pay special attension to the dipstick tube it might have to be removed to do this

2219,21587,how do i start a boiler  it is oil fed  how long do i hold in the button  ,an oil fired boiler doesn t have a pilot flame like a gas boiler does  it fires up automatically when the thermostat calls for heat just like a gas boiler  if the burner flame fails to ignite after about a 30 second timeout period at start up  the burner motor shuts down because you don t want to be spraying oil into the combustion chamber if the flame s not lit  the red button can be pushed once  and only once  to try to restart the burner if it times out after trying to start automatically as it normally does  but usually it won t start and just ends up spraying more oil into the combustion chamber  this is a dangerous condition for the oil repairman because once he fixes the original problem which caused the timeout and failure of the burner to light  the burner may start explosively due to all the excess oil in the combustion chamber  so don t press the red button more than once  and don t hold the red button in  when the repairman arrives  tell him how many times you pressed the red button so he ll know what safety measures to take to restart the burner once it s repaired

2452,114420,how do i test  a starter and alternator in a 1992 pontiac grand am  car turns over  but wont start,debra  the starter must be uninstalled manually after the starter is in your hands set it down on a surface or table near the vehicles battery you will need a pair of jumper cables which you will attach to the battery terminals you must then very carefully touch the cable terminal extensions from the battery to the  bendix  of the starter  this is the mechanism that sends the gears into the starter motor and also contacts with the  flywheel   and the other cable to the body or external armature of the starter the bendix should kick in and the starter should whirl around if the bendix does not engage the problem may be in the terminal relays  if the starter is engaged by the bendix but refuses to whir  then you may have a problem with the starter shaft bushings  if the bushings are worn out this will allow the body of the rotor to make contact with the starter casing which creates an electrical feed that makes the starter shaft rotate and thusly turn over the flywheel which in turn turns over the engine  bushings are easy to replace and if you can learn how to do this you will save a bundle as for the alternator problem you may have a good read out on your battery charging gauge if the alternator is working  another way to find out whether the alternator is putting out energy is to turn your cars  engine on and then disconnecting one of the battery terminals  if the engine dies out you may have a bad alternator  another method is by using an electronic meter to measure the alternators output  and by the way  alternators also fall victim to worn bushings that can be replaced by the owner of the car   have a good one   jose

2948,49131,how do i restring my lawn mower  ,i broke my pull cord about 3 weeks ago and had to do it  fortunately it was right at the end so i didn t even need a new cord  actually  i once broke a cord halfway up and rather than replacing it simply attached the handle to what was left and never had a problem starting it depends on the model  but the advice in the post above is generally right  the cord on most mowers goes thru a small hole on the top or side of the engine cover  around a narrow spool inside of it  and is kept there with a single knot on the other end  inside  of the spool thru a small hole in it  thus remove the engine cover and when removing the spool observe how the cord is attached on the inside  if there is any left   the new one should obviously be attached the same way  it will probably be evident how the cord is attached on the inside  winding on the new cord is a trick  you ll note that  if you didn t ruin anything  how there is tension when you turn the spool a certain direction  you want to wind the cord on in such a way so that when it is pulled it feels the tension as when you turn it with your hand  may have to hold in place with a straight screwdriver to accomplish that when winding and placing the end of the cord up thru the hole  the purpose of that is simply so that it returns to the engine cover after you pull it so you can try again  as little tension as necessary to accomplish that makes starting the engine easier  hard to explain without illustrations for your model not easy but definitely doable   and once you learn how you wont have a problem doing so again

3066,68608,how to do a tune up on an engine  ,like most places in california  the hot topic around the water cooler at our office is the rising cost of gasoline  we have seen a drastic increase in gas prices over the past several months and we haven t even reached the summer yet  there has also been talk of premium unleaded costing three bucks by the time summer exits  thank god my commuter is a miata  stop laughing  and it gets a gas sipping 30 miles a gallon on the highway  unlike my other four vehicles  which are only able to muster 20 or so miles per gallon  keeping them in top shape is a major priority  as many of you might already know  a well maintained vehicle not only saves you money at the pump but can also increase performance  everyday commuters can easily perform some of these tips while some require skills and specialized technical equipment  we will rate each task on a one to 10 scale so you can decide for yourself whether you can perform these tasks or if you should have a hired mechanic perform them for you 1 one of the easiest and simplest preventative steps you can take is checking tire pressure  if a vehicle s tire is not inflated to the proper specifications  it can cause additional drag on asphalt  slowing the vehicle down  not only can the situation waste gas  but it may also lead to hazardous driving conditions  first check the manufacturers pressure rating on the tire s sidewall  it should read something like  maximum tire pressure xx   with that information  inflate the tire pressure of all four tires to two or three psi below the maximum pressure  never inflate the tire past the maximum pressure  difficulty  2 2 if you love your car you must be religious  not it the sense of believing in god  but religious in the sense of changing your oil  oil and filter changes should occur every 3000 miles or even more frequently depending on driving conditions  changing your oil can be as easy as going to the nearest jiffy lube or similar establishments  if you are a do it yourselfer it can be as cheap as  10 if you buy all the parts from your local parts store  dirty old oil can easily turn into sludge  hindering moving parts from moving freely  causing performance loss  poor fuel economy and increased wear  difficulty  1 or 3 for the do it yourselfer 3 another cheap upgrade is your spark plugs  not necessarily with high performance exotic alloy units  but just new factory replacements  an average conventional spark plug has a lifespan of about 30 000 miles  anything past 30 000 miles  and the spark plugs electrode has probably worn off  spark plugs should be checked every 10 000 miles for wear on the electrode and if needed  replaced with new ones  difficulty   2 to 4 depending on vehicle 4 air filters are used on all vehicles for obvious reasons of course  however  over time and depending on driving conditions  the filter can easily be clogged with dirt and debris  if the engine utilizes a panel filter  it can easily be tapped gently on the floor to remove the large debris  pressurized air can remove the smaller debris  office duster works great   make sure you blow the opposite direction of the air flow intake tract to prevent particles from being further embedded into the filter  cone filters can also benefit from spring cleaning and there are cleaning kits available to clean the filter  air filters should be inspected every 10 000 miles and cleaned or replaced when necessary  difficulty  3 to 4 5 depending on what type of ignition system your engine utilizes  some incorporate an ignition cap and rotor for transferring amplified ignition charge to the plug wires  after several hundred thousands transfers of ignition charge  the cap and rotor can wear  which can lead to misfires  the cap and rotor should be checked every 20 000 miles and replaced when the wear is too excessive  difficulty  4 to 5 6 although plug wires rarely go bad  an intermittent ignition misfire can keep you scratching your head for weeks

3226,67050,how do you stop when you drive manual transmission car  using the brake or downshifting  are not you concern about your transmission more then your brake pads considering the difference in their price ,the obvious answer for me is to shift the car into neutral and then use the brakes   brake pad replacement is one heck of a lot cheaper than a clutch replacement and that s not the only thing that wears on on the transmission everytime you shift gears you exercise the syncromesh  associated with each forward gear   reverse generally doesn t need any such syncromesh which is why sometimes it is difficult to get into reverse the clutch throw out bearing is given a large break too when you leave that clutch pedal out as much as possible   in that possition the throw out bearing is not being used   held down to the floor  the throw out bearing is working it s tail off when the transmission is in neutral the engine speed decreases to idle speed  around 800 rpm   at that point i am using very little fuel while the ground under the tires is still passing under the car pretty quickly   that translates to fuel economy   a quick kick up in rpm and i can put it in any gear i want the only reason i can give for downshifting through your deceleration is to gain the capacity for a quick acceleration   that is easily solved with some defensive driving techniques and it really isn t that slow shifting into whatever gear i want when i need it anyway my  90 honda prelude has 230 000 miles on it s original clutch   the only thing that has been replaced is the clutch acutation parts since that is controlled by hydraulics with a master and a slave cylinder similar to the brake system 
3227,66137,how do i measure my roof for shingles  ,in order to estimate how many shingles you ll need  first you need to estimate  the total square footage of your roof s surface  just measure the length and width of each plane on the roof  including dormers  then  multiply length x width to get the square footage of each plane  simply add the square footage of each of the planes together to derive the total square footage of your roof example plane 1  120  x 100    12 000 sq  ft plane 2  120  x 100    12 000 sq  ft plane 1   plane 2   24 000 sq  ft  for the total square footage of the roof roof surfaces are measured in  squares   a  square  is an area of roof which measures 100 square feet  to determine the number of squares on the gable roof above  for example  simply divide its total of 24 000 square feet by 100  which means you will need 240  squares  of shingles to cover it  the most common type of shingle  called a three tab or strip shingle  is generally packaged three bundles per square if this is a new roof  you will also need 240 squares of underlayment  no underlayment is needed if you are applying shingles directly over an existing asphalt roof   underlayment usually comes in rolls of four squares each  so covering 240 squares would require 60 rolls of underlayment good luck

3318,53375,how do i drive a stick     ,driving a standard trasmission vehicle takes practice to become profficient  there are several things your mind and body need to learn  to do at the same time or close to the same time  using first and reverse gears are the most difficult  and down shifting can take a while to get the hang of as well  first you need to get the car moving  this is where first gear is utilized  while slowly letting up on the clutch you will feel a small pressure point in the clutch  this point is where you know to push in the gas just a tad bit and the car  if done correctly  will move forward slowly  it takes getting a full mind and body  feel  of the car  of how the clutch and gas engage each other  while you practice you will jerk a lot and kill the engine  it is getting that combingation of the right clutch release point while giving a bit of gas which starts the car in a forward movement  once you get the car moving you then shift to second gear  the only gears you need to engage both the gas and clutch at the same time are first and reverse  the other gears can be changed just by pressing in the clutch  changing the gear  letting up on the clutch completely and engaging the gas pedal  finding the engagement between first  reverse and the proper amount of gas to apply can be difficult at first  go to a large parking area or a long dirt road and practice  i taught all my kids  8  to drive a standard  we always started with the standard as i feel strongely that once a person masters a standard they will not have any problems with automatics  or trucks  etc  downshifting is important and can be a bit difficult to master too  driving a standard requires using much more of your mind and body than an automatic  you have to be aware of the rpms so you can know when to shift  either up or down  listening to the vehicle with your mind and feeling how it is responding with your body is required with a standard much more than an automatic  automatics are easily driven  requires less mental and physical joining with the vehicle and is not as fun  there is more advantages to driving a standard than getting better gas milage or being able to push start it  when driving a standard you can have much more control of the car  and it is simply fun to drive when you are focusing so much of your mind and body with the car  like i said  just find that point where it feels the clutch has a bit of resistance  slowly press a bit of gas and the car will either go forward  or jerk a lot and then die  as you practice finding that point with the clutch use your whole body to  feel  the car and what it is doing  that is the best advice i can offer anyone who is getting ready to learn to drive a standard  now  some are just naturals and it comes to them easily  while others have to practive a lot  do not allow yourself to get discouraged or think you can t do it  anybody  unless mentally handicapped  can learn to drive a standard  just remember that even after you have the car functioning and on the regular road you will still require time to get all the proper shifting down pat with further practice  try downshifting prior to stopping and making the stop as smooth as possible  also try making your  take off  as smooth as possible as well  by working to make these transistions smooth you will be taking good care of you vehicle  those who get cocky and refuse to believe they need to learn more finesse in standard transmission minipulation after getting it onto the road are very hard on their vehicles which wears the clutch and other parts more quickly but also put otheers at risk by failing to fully master this type of driving  it is so fun to drive a standard with torc and horse power on a windy road   it feels like you are one with the car  joined together and it is a blast   good luck in learning this type of driving  it is a real skill and if you are patient with yourself and allow yourself to fully master this you will have so muc

3868,18220,how to tell if your vehicles transmission is bad  i have a 1993 nissan pathfinder,when good transmissions go bad by heather madigan   carolyn martellcarprices com  the word transmission conjures up dread  perhaps even fear  especially when your mechanic starts to utter   i think your transmission is        your brain is attacked violently by the image of your checkbook being sucked empty by a greedy vacuum  the money you had been saving to go on vacation  or to buy that new computer  ultimately will dwindle to nothing now that there is something wrong with your transmission instead of having to succumb every ounce of your savings to a mechanic  maybe you can diffuse some transmission problems before they set in  the solution is called preventive maintenance  and it comes highly recommended by manufacturers  dealers  mechanics and generally everybody who has a car or knows about them the damage done to a transmission can be catastrophic to your lifestyle  at best  for one thing  while your car sits in the shop  you must get a ride wherever you want to go    grrr  and then there s that little matter of money  rebuilding a transmission is estimated at around  2 150  that s some pretty major incentive to try to maintain the transmission as best you can the basics are a good place to start  the transmission propels the car forward  it is a mechanism that transfers the power produced by the engine  ultimately to spin the wheels of the vehicle  the transmission operates under tremendous heat  therefore it is vital that the fluids are maintained and that extra caution is taken when driving in extreme conditions  such as harsh winter weather or hauling heavy loads  the transmission  however  can overheat by normal driving  pushing the fluid temperatures well beyond safe limits according to the automatic transmission rebuilds association  overheating causes 90 percent of all transmission failures  most of these can be blamed on worn out fluid that should have been replaced  check your transmission fluid level regularly  and actually smell it to find out if it has a burnt odor  if it does smell burnt  it needs to be changed  refer to your car manual to find out specific mileage time intervals to check and change the fluid  which varies from car to car  every 30 000 to 50 000 miles is a good number to keep in mind  performing this sooner will not hurt anything though if there is a reddish leak under your vehicle  this could spell bad news  it s usually the automatic transmission fluid  it is vital at this point to check the fluid level more frequently  whatever you do  do not allow that fluid to run low  the transmission will heat up  breaking down the fluid s ability to lubricate and cool  this will increase friction and heat  which will wear out the transmission prematurely  use the transmission fluid that is recommended in the car manual or printed on the dipstick  using the wrong type of fluid can affect the way the transmission shifts and feels  causing it to shift too harshly or slip under heavy loads getting the vehicle stuck in mud or snow can cause another potential hazard to the transmission    as well as the whole vehicle  seeing as how it is stuck somewhere  it always is suggested that you dig your vehicle out or get towed vs  the alternative  and at one time or another  we all have seen    or perhaps resorted to    the jump on the bumper method to gain traction to rock the vehicle free  this can shock the transmission more than it can handle  and internal parts can start to break the life of any automobile is extended when it is taken care of properly  so  what if you do change the fluids and keep up on the fluid levels  and it still overheats  remember  this is a machine and machines break  do what you can to keep your transmission in good health by performing regularly scheduled maintenance checks  there isn t much more you can do other than hiding the vehicle in the garage  and that s no fun

4120,13055,how to fix a leak in a 2  pvc pipe arround a swiming pool without a trench  the trouble is in the return circuit to the pool,you don t there are two options  1  replace the entire line   requires a lot of digging 2  have a pool pro pressure test the line  he can do a leak location during the test and tell you within 6 inches or so where the leak is located  even under 6 inches of concrete and 3 feet down   less digging and cheaper than replacing the entire line  then it s just a matter of digging out an area one man can work in  down to the break and inserting a coupling in the line  typically  the hole in the deck can be just 2 feet by 2 feet in most cases and easily patched when the repair is done  the colour won t match if this is a concrete deck   i m afraid  but there s no getting around that  typically  the pressure test and leak location costs anywhere between 50   100 dollars depending on how long it takes them due to the nature of the pool and it s equipment  the actual repair  you could do yourself  but it s back breaking  requires working in a tight space  be good with basic hand tools and have a spotter ready to pull you out if you initiate a cave in with your head down that hole  if you get someone in to do the repair  the rate usually starts at about 200 dollars  unless it s a line just under dirt  and can easily top 600 if it s in a bad spot  if there s no way you want to cut the deck  like a stamped coloured concrete deck  then tunneling  when the leak is located is an option  but very expensive  i ve dug a 12 foot one once under a garden that couldn t be disturbed to the leak and the bill came to over 1200 dollars

4123,111899,how do i go about fixing holes in plaster walls  i recently pulled my baseboards off and there were some holes there was water damage to my house and when i went to remove my old baseboards some of the plaster just crumbled leaving gaping holes   i need to put up new baseboards  but don t have much to nail them to ,you can buy some sheetrock at a lumber yard or home improvement center  or maybe even pick up some free scraps   cut it with a utility knife to size and screw pieces in place with dry wall screws to replace the crumbled plaster  you may have to remove more plaster to expose the studs  which are the best places to screw the sheetrock to  i m assuming you are talking about lath  wooden strips  and plaster in your wall  if what s crumbling is sheetrock  hard plaster between two sheets of paper   then just cut out the bad parts with a utility knife  back to a stud  after you ve screwed on the new sheetrock pieces  use joint compound to plaster up the gaps  if you ve just got small holes  you can just use joint compound to fill them up  you could also just apply joint compound over big areas of lath  but i find for larger gaps that it works better to screw up a piece of sheetrock to cover most of the hole  then patch up the edges  if your crumbling wall is sheetrock  measure the thickness of it so you can buy the same thickness  if it s lathe and plaster  measure the thickness from the surface of the lathe to the surface of the plaster also note that joint compound  shrinks when it dries  its best to apply it to the holes  smoothing with a putty knife  let it completely dry  a day   then do it again  it will have cracked and sunk in spots   professionals also use joint tape  but this seems overkill since the repair will be hidden behind a baseboard

4152,76479,how does solar water heaters work  ,solar water heaters perform three basic operations before the hot water comes out of your tap 1  energy collection  sunlight is collected and converted to heat energy the solar collector is mounted on or near your home facing south  as the sunlight passes through the collector s glazing  it strikes an absorbing material  this material converts the sunlight into heat  and the glazing prevents the heat from escaping in a similar manner to leaving a car parked in the sun with its windows rolled up  the temperature inside a glazed solar collector on your roof can easily reach 150 c when there is no heat transfer fluid flowing through it the two most common types of solar collectors used in solar water heaters are glazed flat plate and evacuated tube collectors  a glazed flat plate collector consists of a shallow rectangular box with a transparent glass  window  covering a flat black plate  the black plate is attached to a series of parallel tubes or one serpentine tube through which air  water  or other heat transfer fluids pass an evacuated tube collector consists of several individual glass tubes  each containing a black metal pipe through which the heat transfer fluid passes  the space between the pipe and the glass tube is  evacuated   so the air is removed although uncommon  unglazed plastic collectors can be used as a seasonal solar water heating system  however  they are used mostly for pool heating  each collector has its advantages  and each can perform well if matched with the proper  well designed  storage unit 2  energy transfer  circulating fluids transfer the collected energy in the form of heat to a storage tank heat energy is transferred from the collector to the water storage tank  in some water heaters  hot fluid is pumped from the collector to the storage tank  the pump is powered by electricity that either comes from an electrical wall outlet or a small photovoltaic module located beside the collector in other types of solar water heaters  the sun heats the storage tank directly  so the fluid in the collector is heated and rises naturally to a storage tank above the collector  this type of solar water heater is often referred to as a thermosiphon system  it does not  require an electric pump  passive solar and solar photovoltaic powered systems will continue to operate even if there is a power outage  the products that require electricity from a wall outlet will not operate during a power outage 3  energy storagesolar heated water is stored in an insulated tank until you need it  hot water is drawn off the tank when tap water is used  and cold make up water enters at the bottom of the tank solar water heaters tend to have a slightly larger hot water storage capacity than  conventional water heaters  this is because solar heat is available only during the day and sufficient hot water must be collected to meet evening and morning requirements

4203,76089,how do i light a heater that has a push button but no pilot light  this heater was working when they installed it   during the warmer weather i turned it off and now somehow the pilot light got turned out   i can t seem to get it relit and very cold weather is coming at the end of this week   i am a single mom with two young boys   help ,look for a set of instructions that may appear on one of the panels of the heater    they may read something like this    1  turn the gas dial to  pilot     while pressing down on the gas dial  press the red push button a few times until the pilot is lit     2  keep holding down the gas dial for about 30 seconds   then release it   if the pilot light goes out  you probably need to replace your thermocouple  see below    if it stays let  turn the gas dial to on   otherwise  turn to off and leave the whole thing alone for 5 minutes to let any gas disapate replaciing a thermocouple      this is a common home repair   a common repair for any gas appliance with a standing pilot light   the thermocouple is a small metal device that makes sure that there is heat where the pilot light is supposed to be  if it doesn t detect heat  it shuts off the gas valve as a safety precaution  when you are holding down the pilot knob during startup  you are essentially bypassing the thermocouple long enough to heat it up  over time  the thermocouple degrades and dies   killing the pilot light and preventing it from staying on during an attempt to re light it you can call an hvac guy and for about  100  or so  they will stop by  after another day or two without heat  and replace this part for you   if you rent  get your land lord to repair it   occasionally you will encounter a crook  they are in all lines of work  who will tell you to replace the furnace and will try to charge you  1000s want to try this repair yourself  take a look at the heater and try to determine the length of the thermo couple  use the link below to get an idea of what it looks like and how it is connected  they come in different lengths  if you are in doubt you can error on the side of getting one a little too long  i think they are about  10 20 or so at lowes  truck yourself down to the hardware store and get one  turn off the gas to your house if you feel safer  good time to learn how to do this   usually just need an adjustable wrench at the outside gas meter remove the old thermocouple noting where the screws held it in place  save the screws  you ll likely need them to install the new one  you may not need some of the parts that come with the new one  this is okay  install the new one by screwing or snapping it into place  turn gas back on to house  relight your pilot light following the procedure you did before  hold down button for at least a minute  this time the pilot light should stay on  smell for leaks paranoid  install a co detector near your hot water heater  keep the wrench handy for house shutoff    but if you have a leak  first get everyone out  have never leaks and i ve replaced several themocouples  furnace igniters  a gas clother dryer  gas cooktop  and even several whole hot water tanks  so take the precautions you want to  but don t be overly paranoid you may need to re light pilot lights of other gas appliances having turned off the house gas this is a fairly common repair  so learning how to do this will save you a few hundred more bucks when it happens again good luck

4311,65707,how do i know how much air to put in car tires  i m rather new at cars and my car tires are sagging  i don t quite know how much air i should put in them with a standard gas station air pump ,wow  so many answers  so few correct   it amazes me that so few people actually know how much air to put in there tires   no disrespect to you  you are just asking the question   the psi marked on the side of your tire is the max inflation that tire is rated at   it should say something like  35 psi at 1300 lbs    what this means is if your car weighs  5200 lbs you should run 35 psi according to the tire manufacturers specs   if your car weighs 3500 lbs  35 psi is to much to run   there is actually a formula to use to calculate the proper inflation pressure if you are that critical about it   my assumption is that you are not  you just want to know how much air to put in your tires   if you check the id tag in your door jamb it will tell you how much your car weighs and how much air to put in the tires   the only problem i have with this is that car manufactures tend to go on the low side with this because it gives you a smoother ride and may tend to prematurely wear out the tires but if it helps them sell cars they will tell you whatever they want   it has already been said at least once  if you are just not sure  run them at 32 psi   if you have a standard run of the mill car  any mid size or compact  this will be fine no matter what size tires you have   i have a one ton truck with 10 ply tires on it  on the side of the tires it says  max inflation 80 psi at xxxx lbs     1800 or something   do i run 80 psi   heck no  i run them at 40 all day long   if i am hauling a big load i jack them up to whatever i need to to handle the load   i have a durango with 31 10 50 15 6 ply s   they say 50 psi max  i run them at 30  35 if i am going on a long trip with luggage and such   i have  a 70 bug with 165 15 s  i run them at 32 all the time   i run my tire pressures according to my driving habits and comfort   my durango has some aftermarket suspension mods that already make it ride like a caddy so the softer tires make it even nicer   i drive my bug pretty fast and where i live there are a lot of twisty roads and the higher pressure helps with the cornering and squeezes every bit of mileage out of the fuel   the reason i tell you all of this is so you can see just how  uncritical  it really is   oh yeah  about the over inflation   your tires are most likely radials  they do look a little low on air all of the time  that is they way they are designed   in the old days whey bias tires were the norm overinflation was a bad thing because of heat buildup   you could actually blow a tire if it had to much air in it   in radials that is pretty much out the window   on average even on a hot day on hot asphalt you will gain only about 2 3 psi in your tires   not enough to worry about   if your tires are overinflated by 5 psi it won t really hurt anything so don t lose sleep over it   that is what radials are all about  they hold their form  they are made out of steel not nylon   the two best pieces of advice i could give you would be this  always keep your tires evenly inflated and rotate them every 5000 miles   i hope this lengthy answer has been helpful  i tried to be as informative as i possibly could without being too confusing
