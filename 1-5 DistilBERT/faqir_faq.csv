Hi,I have some tree sap on my car, both older (pretty dry) and some newer from a redwood tree.Any tips on how to remove it?",I have had good luck with commercial products available at auto supply stores for just a few dollars.

1,40807,How do I get a sticker off of a car window  (plastic part)?  Nail polish remover seems risky? ,"Goo Gone is a fantastic product (available at Target and most any hardware store or drug store) and works amazingly well on even pesky sticker residue.  Soak the area, and wipe it away.  It might take repeated applications, but you can remove the sticker without scratching, and without leaving a gooey residue.Note that Goo Gone can affect some surfaces, including some plastics, so you should be careful, especially if it is clear plastic.  I've used Goo Gone many times on plastic glassic and CD cases, so it will certainly work on many plastics, but you should be careful. In the event that Goo Gone seems too risky, you can frequently remove just the adhesive residue using plain old Scotch tape.  Remove as much of the sticker as possible (the paper/plastic backing) and then apply tape to the sticker residue firmly.  Pull the tape off sharply, and some of the residue will come with it.  This is a slow process so only do it if the area is relatively small, however, I frequently use this tactic for price tags and the like and it is surprisingly effective."
2,57727,How to get rid of garbage disposal odor? ,"1. Inspect the black rubber cover that fits in the disposal. Sometimes bits of garbage collect under the flaps and create a smell.    2. Clean the rubber cover, if necessary. If yours lifts out, remove it and clean away debris with a scrub brush and warm, soapy water. If your rubber cover is installed permanently, lift up each flap and clean it with soapy water and an old toothbrush.    3. Deodorize the disposal. Cut a lemon in half and drop the fruit and a handful of baking soda into the disposal. Turn on the cold water faucet and then the disposal. The unit will clean itself as it grinds up the mixture."

5,29738,How to unclog a tub? ,"1. Get a pair of tweezers or an old small scissors in order to lift long hair out from the drain, or whatever may be causing the clog.  Try running hot water down the drain, and see if it goes down quickly.  If it is still too slow, and collecting in the tub, try putting a half-cup of baking soda in the drain, then pour a half-cup of vinegar immediately afterwards.  Then rinse with water.2. Another way to unclog a tub is to use chemical products such as Drano or LiquidPlumr.  Just don't use vinegar and then use the chemical product at the same time! 3.  Have you tried using a plunger?  This may also work.  Move the plunger in an up-and- down motion quickly, loosening the clog as you go. If everything didn't work, call a professional to snake the drain, and remove the entire clog from the drain."
6,119279,How do you quiet a squeaky door? ,"Spray WD-40 directly onto the hinges of the door.  Open and close the door several times.  Remove hinges if the door still squeaks.

7,40331,How to fix a vacuum cleaner? My vacuum cleaner sucks!  It sucks dirt weakly.,"Check the hose, wand and cleaning tools for obstructions. Debris often collects where one part plugs into another, or where the hose connects to the main vacuum housing. Remove the parts one at a time and remove any debris you find.  Clear any hidden obstructions by pushing a broom handle through the hose and wands.  Reassemble all the parts.  You may also have to replace the drive belt.1. Unplug the machine and flip it over so you can access the agitator brush.  2. Unscrew the bottom plate that holds the brush in place, using a screwdriver.    3. Lift out the brush by pulling the roller ends out of the slots in the vacuum base. If the drive belt isn't completely broken, one end will be wrapped around the agitator brush, the other around the motor drive shaft. Slide the belt off of each part. Take it to a hardware store to get a replacement.    4. Inspect the agitator brush before installing the new belt. Sometimes thread or hair will wrap around the ends or elsewhere on the brush roller. This can prevent the agitator from turning and cause a belt to fail prematurely. Cut any thread or hair with a sharp knife and pull it off.    5. Install the new belt. Slide one end over the agitator brush and the other over the drive shaft. Then reinstall the agitator brush. You may have to pull on the agitator brush to stretch the new belt a bit so the roller ends fit into the vacuum base.    6. Reinstall the bottom plate."

9,91753,"how do i know when to replace tires on my car? if there are no abnormal bumps or bruises. there seem to be some tread depth markers in the grooves on the tire, but what exactly do those mean?","If you are starting to run into the wear bars, you should replace your tires.  The tread depth indicators usually denote around 2/32"" of tread depth remaining, which is the minimum requirement in many states.  With the rainy season starting, that small amount of tread depth will be MUCH more subseptible to hydroplaning than a new tire.  Also, even if tires have a lot of tread, the rubber can break down and cause problems.  You can usually tell when a tire is being very loud on the highway and rebalancing won't fix the problem.  Please see the link below for expert advice from The Tire Rack on when to change tires."
10,27793,"How can I make a clean cut in something that is both metal and wood? Hi - I've got a door threshold to put in. It's a pre-fab thing that I got from Home Depot. It has interlocking wood and metal components, and I want to cut it to length. What tool would people recommend to make a clean cut that will require cutting through both metal and wood at once?","I'm no expert, but generally speaking, a finer-toothed saw will make cleaner cuts (and slower ones ;-) ).  Among hand tools, I'd try a hack saw; for handheld power tools, a fine-toothed circle saw or perhaps one of those ""super disks""; and for table-based power tools, a band saw.  Either way, take your time.By the way, if you've got significant excess length, you can always practice a couple of different approaches before making the final cut."

14,94346,how do you stop a squeaky garage door? Have an automatic garage door that really squeaks.  Does not seem related to the opener itself but to the rollers on the sides.  I've tried lubricating them to no avail.,"Quote: ""Squeaky doors can be a real nuisance. Fortunately, there are several very easy fixes for this common problem. Here are some tips...Try spraying a little WD-40 (TM ) oil directly into the door hinges, with the door still attached. Operate the door to check and see if that eliminated the squeak...If the door still squeaks, apply a little powdered lubricant (e.g., powdered graphite) inside the hinge (/ squeaky part)...If you don't have any powdered lubricant, you could try using some household materials that you may have handy. Try rubbing petroleum jelly or candle wax on the hinge...repeat these steps on the other hinge(s) if necessary. ""If that doesn't work, check for rust or other gunk on the rails and wheels that may be causing extra squeaking at certain door positions."

16,48304,"How can I make my car interior less noisy? I have a 2001 civic, but on highways at high speeds it is really loud inside the car. I googled for soundproof car, but couldn't find much helpful info - how much might it cost? what kind of car place would do it (body shop, repair shop, ?)?","Go to a Car stereo shop.  The reason you would go there is because sound dampening is part of high end car audio systems.  The last thing you want is road noise on your expensive car audio system.There are items you can buy such as spray on material, adhesive pads, and non-adhesive fabric type material.  Dynamat is the big popular provider of sound dampening materials, but there are online places like partsexpress.com which will sell you cheaper no-name dampening material.  Just look it up in their car-audio section.You will likely find that decreasing the noise is gonna cost you a good chunk of change and a lot of work.  Usually you need to 'dampen' (add sound deadening material) the doors and floor.  You can also do the roof if that is the main source of your problem.  If you are a DIY'er it can all be done for a few hundred dollars assuming you are comfortable with disassemblign your cars interior parts.  I would let a pro do this as there is too much potential to break panels and improperly install the materials."
17,101051,"How can I tell the health of my manual transmission? How can I tell the health of my manual transmission and clutch?I am currently running more horsepower (400hp) than stock on a Subaru WRX. I am using synthetic transmission fluid (Redline), and usually drive gentle on the shifts. Still, every once in a while I thrash on the car. How can I inspect or evaluate the current health of the transmission and clutch?","The best way to check the condition of the manual transmission is take out the drain plug. Be sure to catch the fluid in a clean container since you are using synthetics. The drain plug should be magnetic on the tip. If it is not, you should replace it with one that is.It serves two purposes, 1) to easily see if there is excess metal in the transmission and 2) there will all ways be some bits of metal thrown off by the gears and the magnet captures it and keeps it at the bottom of the sump so it does not act as an abrassiveto cause damage to the bearings and bushings.The clutch is a wear item and with 400 Hp you will know when the clutch is wearing thin...it will start to slip..probably in 3rd or 4th gears to begin with that much Hp and you will notice ""feel"" of the clutch pedal gets very narrow on engagement."
18,43846,"how do i know if my wood burning fire place/chimney chute is open or closed? I just bought a place with a wood burning fire place. Problem is, I can't tell if the thing is open or closed. How do I know?",Take a piece of newspaper and roll/twist it onto itself to shape it into a skinny breadstick.  Open the door to your woodburner and ignite one end of the newspaper leaving the door to the woodburner open.  If the smoke goes out and does not come back into the living area then your flue/chute is open.

20,60547,how to know when to change tires? ,"The most common reason to replace tires is insufficient tread depth. The grooves in the tire channel water away to prevent hydroplaning, which results in a loss of traction. When a tire has less than 3/32"" tread depth, it's ability to channel the water is diminished and it's time to replace it. A rule of thumb is to stick a penny in the tread with the top of Lincoln's head parallel to the surface of the tire. If any part of his head is exposed, the tire should be replaced. Most tires also have tread wear indicators that show as bars across the tire when there's insuffucuent tread.Anytime a tire has small cracks in the sidewall, or is mis-shapen in any way, it should be replaced."
21,67600,how do i overhaul a gasoline engine? my engine emits white smoke,"Start with the simple:Replace spark plugsChange OilReplace Oil FilterWhite smoke is often burning oil.If an oil change and spark plug change doesn't fix your problem try a thicker oil (try 20/50 instead of 10/40).If your car creates tons of white smoke you might want to think about:Check compression in the head with a compression gauge.If compression is too low (need to check specs on your engine) then:1) Have valves ground (you could do this yourself, but paying a pro makes sense).2) Replace the rings on the pistons.3) Have head ground.If this doesn't fix your problem, you need a major overhaul."

24,18399,how do you get stucco level on a wall?? ,"The best way to make stucco look smooth (level?)is to spray it with something called a ""hopper gun"" which can be purchased usually in the paint dept. of any national hardware store such as Home Depot. Even with a hopper gun it is difficult... and if you have no experience I suggest practicing until you can get the look you desire. The instructions that come with the gun will help you get started but there is nothing like experience. There is infomation on the container of most stucco products that tell you how much water you can add to the material - water makes the product spray easier but slows drying time. While it is possible to spread stucco and get a smooth surface - this would take far more practice. If you want to check out the product I just put on the front of my own home (Tuff 2) here's the URL:http://www.styro.net/FoundationandICFCoatings.html.htmlI don't sell, own, or have any interest in this company but I can tell you from my experience they are extremely customer friendly--AND they have short videos of the application of stucco you can watch (if you have access to high speed internet) Hope this helps.....Jeff"
25,6073,how can i get the sewer layout of my house? i am having sewer problem with my line,"If the house was built in the last 20 years or so, the town building department should have ""as built"" measurements and maybe a sketch.If its older and there are no records, then you can:A) call a septic repair service, as they know the tricks of the trade.ORB) get a 6' long piece of 1/2"" steel reinforcing rod and pound it into the ground with a 5lb. hammer at locations where you think the tank(s) may be. Once you find the tank cover, you may be able to look inside and see if the tank is stopped up, or see what direction the lines go to.Most septic pumping contractors will find the tank(s) at no charge if you are paying them to pump it out, which you will probably need to do."

31,31271,how do you change car oil? ,First read your manual and find out how much and what kind of oil your car needs.  This is very important on newer cars whose tolerance is so small.Then go to the autoparts store and ask for a filter for your car and get the oil you need.  You should also have an oil filter wrench.  I reccomebd the ring kind not the kind tha fits over the top ore the visegrip kind.You might also want to get something conviniant to catch the oil in and tote it around.  You will need to take it back to a place that collects old oil.Then get on your back and find the drain plug.  Wait till you car is cool though.  Undo the plug and let the oil drain into the pan you got.  Next you need to find your oil filter.  You have a new one so you should be able to look for something the same shape.  it may be a different color though.Turn the old filter counter clock wise.  be ready though oil will come out a small amount anyway.Turn it over on your drain pan and let the rest run out of the filter.Put a small amount of oil on your finger and rub the gasket on the new filter.  Put it where the old one was and hand tighten only.  If it is easy to do without spilling oil you you should also prime the filter by pouring some oil into it.Replace the filter and the drain plug.  Fill you car oil fill (under the hood) to the recommended amount.  Replace the cap.  I have forgotten to do that a couple of times.  Boy did my wife get mad when her car was smoking.Mkae sure to take your oil and filter to a place which collects them.  Usually most chain autoparts stores will.M

34,15482,how can i deactivate auto headlights on a 99 chevy blazer? ,"Ok I posted a link below for you to follow, very good source there. Now the DRL or daytime running lamps are something completely different, they are on all the time until you switch on the headlights. Now the auto headlights have a little black sensor on top of the dash by your defroster vents that turn on your headlights when it senses that the light outside is getting dim. They flip on going under bridges and everything else and get a little annoying. Did I follow you right on that one? Now if you want to kill the daytime running lamps do what is suggest above, open the hood and look for the big underhood fuse box and on the lid of that box there will be a diagram on there of what all the fuses and relays are for. Pull the black or gray relay that goes to the drl's and you are done. There is absolutely nothing bad about pulling them. They are NOT for the people who cannot see and not for the handicapped, people who cannot see a car are obviously not going to see lights during the daytime anyway. Their was a research project done back in 95 or 96 saying they did help visibility and reduce crashes but their were several more projects done that proved that wrong and some even said they were distracting. Look now, most vehicles do not have them, some run just front park lamps and a few have drls but the majority of the companies killed the drls, what is suggested below works but it also drags the rear brakes some and keeps either your drums or discs pretty hot. I used one of those infared thermometers and found mine were in fact dragging with one click enough to heat up the rear brakes substantially."

36,14109,How do I replace my showerhead? ,"Most showerheads hand-screw off. My showerhead is like that. However, be careful when you unscrew it. Make sure you have a pipe wrench and clamp the pipe (where the showerhead connects to) tight. You don't want to turn or break the pipe that's sticking out of the wall. You can get teflon/plumbers tape at Home Depot. Make sure you put at least 1-2 layers of the tape around the threads in the pipe before installing the new showerhead. This will help against leaks. Again, don't forget the pipe wrench and hold the pipe while screwing in the showerhead.Here is a link I found on the DIY webpage:http://www.diynetwork.com/diy/ba_faucets_fixtures/article/0,2037,DIY_13710_2272541,00.html"

39,54287,"How do you tell if a ceiling fan is turning clockwise? Seriously.  When you are determining if a ceiling fan is turning clockwise, do you picture a clock with its face toward the floor or a clock with its face toward the ceiling?  Surprisingly, most people I ask say they picture a clock with its face up toward the ceiling.  This seems completely wrong to me.The question is important (well, kind of) because ceiling fan instructions say the fan should be turning clockwise in one season versus another to cool the room properly.","You would picture a clock with its face toward the floor. Then if you have the fan running in its slowest mode, you can watch the fan blades and see if they turn clockwise (the same direction the hands of a clock turn) or counterclockwise (the opposite direction the hands of a clock turn).It would have to be considered 'face-down' because the best way to tell if something is turning in a certain direction is to look at it head-on. It wouldn't be 'head-on' if you had to consider it as facing the ceiling."

42,14725,how do i mark a roof off to shingle my house? ive been told i need two vertical lines? ,"The horizontal chalk line keeps the rows in a straight line while the vertical chalk line keeps the courses square in an upright straight line.  The horizontal chalk line measurement is the width of a shingle which is 13 3/8"". The rake chalk line gives roofer a guideline to follow when cutting off the excess shingle overhang. To start the horizontal chalk line, find a comfortable and safe location near the lower end of roof along the fascia board roof line and with measuring tape, mark 12 3/8"" from edge of overhang up.  Although the shingle width is 133/8"" wide, 12 3/8"" is used to obtain a one-inch shingle overhang over facsia board and rakes. (barge board)  Do the same to opposite end and connect the two marks with a chalk line strike. Repeat the process to the rake chalk line which is up the incline roof surface on both ends.  The rake chalk line has the same measurements as the horizontal chalk line (12 3/8"" plus one inch for overhang) To mark the vertical chalk line use the shingle length (39 3/8"") as the measurement, but mark 38 3/8"" instead (allowing one inch for shingle overhang again) from edge of plywood (rakes) inward along the horizontal chalk line at the lower end and top end along the ridge.  Use chalk line and snap a line between the two points, but extend the chalk line pass the horizontal line all the way down to the edge of fascia line to get a complete line. Before shingles are nailed in place the vertical and horizontal chalk line must be perpendicular or at right angles ( 90 degrees) to each other. Check the lines for square by using the Pythagorean theorem of 3:4:5 method.  In a right angle triangle with sides of 3, 4, and 5, the sum of square 3 and 4 is equaled to square of hypotenuse which is 5. eg: 3x3=9       4x4=16       5x5=25 On an average roof inclined surface of 16 feet, double or tripple the 3:4:5 method for larger measurements to check roof square - 6:8:10 or 9:12:15. Where the two lines intersect, measure four feet up the vertical line and place a mark (labeled A) and on horizontal line measure three feet out from intersecting point and mark B.  The distance between point A and B should measure five feet.  If the measurement is more or less than five feet then adjustments would have to be made."
43,78033,how do you install a standard seam roof? I would like illustrations and directions on how to install a standard seam roof,"Bob Vila has a good guide:A standing seam metal roof can be fabricated on the jobsite in a few days--and last for the life of the homeMetal roofing's attributes are impressive. Durable and long lasting, a metal roof requires little maintenance, can be retrofitted over many existing roofing materials, is available in a wide range of colors and styles, and is fire resistant. Standing seam metal roofs, popular in areas diverse as the hot and humid South and frigid New England, have shed their industrial roots to become an architectural statement.A standing seam roof is constructed of many interlocking panels that run vertically from the roof's ridge (the top of the roof) to the eave. The interlocking seam where two panels join together is raised above the roof's flat surface, allowing water to run off without seeping between panels."

If you have a dirt floor in the basement, seal it with plastic to keep the humidity out of the house. At some point old single pane windows will condense with water vapor and there's very little that can be done."
47,93686,"How do I replace a serpentine belt that has slipped on a 98 Ford Escort Zx2? My serpentine belt keeps slipping off.  Everytime it rains, the sucker slips.  Then I have to have it towed to a mechanic.  Three trips (and nearly $600) later, it has come off AGAIN!  Can anyone point me to directions (or diagram) on how I can fix this problem myself?  Also, what tool(s) will I need?","Hi Kelly there are two parts to the answer to your question. The first part is how to do it and what tools are needed. That answer is here. http://www.rldassociates.com/zx2/howto/belt.htmThe second part is why does it keep coming off. The answer to this is trickier. Serpentine belts must be very carefully aligned. Even an eighth of an inch out of alignment can cause the belt to slip off or fail prematurely. Once the belt is installed you must be sure that the two idler pulleys and the belt pretensioner pully (see diagram at URL above) are exactly in line. One way to do this, if you have a good eye is to sight down the edge of the belt from several angles to be sure that all of the edges match. If they don't you will need to adjust one or more of the pulleys. Another, more accurate way is to place a straight edge (a metal yardstick would be perfect, but a piece of pipe or angle iron could be used too, against the edges of the belt to be sure that all of them are perfectly in line. If everything is lined up and the belt is properly tensioned that should take care of your problem permanently. If it doesn't, the pretensioner is probably either worn out or out of adjustment. Ford uses nylon spacers in the pretensioner and they can become brittle and fail because of age and the heat in the engine compartment. Good luck with this. I hope it helps. It's a job with some challenges because of how difficult it is to get at all of the twists and turns of the belt."

50,137912,"How do you increase hot water pressure in my kitchen faucet, it runs verrrrry slow, like a trickle? ",First we need to find out if your supply piping is copper or iron. If it is iron the pipes are most likely rusty & corroded inside causing restriction of flow. You can also try changing the aerator (that little screen at the end of the spout) if flow is also slow on the cold water side. Most likely it is the supply pipe as hot water will speed up the corrosion which is why you dont see any slowness on the cold side. If iron pipe the only solution would be to repipe the entire house. I highly recommend using a union contractor as they have the best trained and most efficient workforce.

52,20818,How does the gas pump know when your tank is full? ,"According to the website below:When your gas gauge reads empty, your tank is filled with air instead of fuel.  As you add fuel, the air must move out of the tank to make way for the gas.  Next time you fill your car at the gas station, take a look at the pump nozzle.  You will find a hole about a half inch from the end of the nozzle.  This hole is connected to a small pipe that travels through the nozzle to the handle.When you fill your gas tank, some of the displaced air flows through the hole in the nozzle into the pipe.  When the tank is full, the hole will be below the gasoline level and no air will pass through the pipe.  A mechanical switch inside the nozzle detects when the flow of air stops and shuts off the gas.You may have noticed that, after the pump shuts off, you can get more gas in your tank by pulling the nozzle out of the tank a bit.  This is because you’re moving the position of the hole relative to the gas level and allowing the mechanical switch to reopen."

The door will close, but the part of the lock that goes into the hole of the frame is lower than the hole in the frame.","If the problem is the bolt does not line up properly with the stike you can adjust the stike plate. This is sometimes caused by normal settling of the structure. There are several things you can check if this is an existing lock. First check and see if all your hinges are screwed in tight, if the hinge screws have loosened over a period of time this will cause the door to sag slightly and cause a misalignment. Second make sure the screws is the lockset are properly tightened. In the case of typical entry knobs and dead bolts it is best to tighten the latch bolts first and than the screws through the lockset.If every thing else seems up to snuff you can place a small amount of paint on the bolt while the bolt is retracted. Close the door and work the knob or the lockset a couple of times. This will leave a mark on the door jamb or strike plate where the lock bolt is hitting. You will than be able to determine where the strike plate may need be adjusted or the hole enlarged."

Any ideas? ThanksLeo",You have to install some type of cold air return as suggested above. if you put in a simple floor vent your problem will be solved. you should place one vent in each room you want heated although not completely necessary this will be the best way to get the heat around. The vents will work one of two ways either the heat will come up the stair case and go into the rooms you want to heat while the cold are returns to the basement through the vent or (and more likely) the heat will rise up through the vents and the cold air will return to the basement through the stair way. If you only put one vent in and get one room heated you can buy small supper quiet fans then mount in the upper corner of a doorway. they use next to no electricity and are very quiet but then get the air moving and make a big difference.

One was in a ford and it had a big hole in the side of the block. You could look in one side of the block and see out the other. The other was a chevy and when I took the oil pan off there was pieces of the rod laying in the oil pan. If you threw a rod and the car runs it will shake really bad and probably knock very loud. If the car won't run than you will have to put a wrench on the crankshaft pully bolt and see if you can turn the motor over by hand. either way you will have to pull the oil pan off to see what it looks like inside.

125,30203,"how do I clean and sanitize a moldy, smelly car interior? My car was left in a damp garage for a few weeks and developed this hideous layer of mold over the complete interior of the car. I mean every square inch! I had the car detailed which got rid of all the visible mold but the car still has very strong moldy smell to it.  Even when the windows are open the smell is overwhelming.Now I have a kid and I need to make sure the car is clean and safe for him. Any ideas?","You're gonna need chemicals. Lysol, Ozium are good starts. Park the car outside, switch the A/C on full blast, and make sure it's on outside air (not recirc). Roll up the windows and get out of the car. If you look near the windshield wipers, you should be able to see a vent near the base of the windshield. Spray lysol into this vent, about 1/4 of the can. This will kill all the mold that's hiding in your vents, as well as blast lysol into your interior. Let the car run for a few minutes after wards then shut it off. This should help quite a bit. Next is to treat it with Ozium a few times to get rid of what's left of the smell. I'm sure there's other methods that work better, but this is easy to do yourself and costs less than $10.

126,133740,"How do I trace back phone wires to see where the disconnect is? The phone jack in the bedroom stopped working, and I dont believe it is the wiring to the jack itself, or the phone, that is not working.","First, go to radio shack and purchase a phone line tester for $5.19Then unplug Every device that plugs into a phone line and test the jack with the device. Draw a map of the rooms in the house and mark the working and non working jacks on it.Make sure you test all jacks including ones where other devices plug into the phone jack such as answering machines, caller ID boxes, Sat Dish receivers, Computer modems, Digital photo frames, alarm systems, ""the box that you use when you have fallen and can't get up"", etc.Once you look at a map of the bad jacks, you will have an idea of where to start. Phone wires are easy to check. If you have one line it is usually hooked up to the Red and Green Wires. If you have two lines, then line two is almost always on Black and Yellow. Know where all the wires come into the house.Check the non working jack that is closest to where the wires come into the house First. One wire off can knock out all the jacks after it.Make sure the wire is exactly on the one screw it is supposed to be on and does not have a chance to tough any other wire or screw.Be systematic moving from one jack to the next. It could be in the jack, or in the wire. Just because a wire does not look broken, does not mean that the wire is not broken.If this does not work, you should go to last Working Jack or jacks which are nearest the first one not working. Check that all the wires are hooked up there properly. This is not rocket science. You can do this yourself. If you can not get the phone tester, you can use the cheapest wired phone you have and plug it in as you move from jack to jack instead.Good Luck"

129,91482,How do you get a large blood stain out of a matress? ,"Blood stains can be one of the most difficult spots to remove from any kind of fabric. If you have a blood stain on your mattress, treat it with some hydrogen peroxide. Pat the stain with a towel (one that you don’t mind bleaching, preferably white), working from the outer circle of the stain in. You will notice the spot start to bubble as the hydrogen peroxide works to remove the stain. Keep applying and blotting the spot until the blood is removed. Warning: Hydrogen peroxide can bleach fabric. Using it on your mattress may bleach it. Make sure you spot-check your mattress before applying hydrogen peroxide.Also - if there is any way to set it in the sun, outside, for a few hours after you've cleaned it, the sun is a great bleaching tool.  (Plus, it helps refresh the mattress, and rid it of any unpleasant odors.)"
130,104209,"how to stop coolant leak? A tiny, slow leak, between engine block and water pump, only when the engine is running.",Try tightening the bolts holding water pump to block. I am assuming the pump is installed into the block and not remote mounted.  The leak could also be coming from the weep hole in the pump (small hole in the pump casing) - in which case the seal is leaking and you must replace the pump.You can try the siver leak stuff but it will gum up the rest of the cooling system - not the best idea.If tightening bolts and silver leak stuff fail it is time to pull pump and change the gasket and us a little Permatex when installing the new gasket or o-ring(type dependant).  If you go though the hassle of pulling the pump it is also a good idea to just change the water pump while you are there as the price of the pump is small compared to time involved in changing the pump. (After fixing the gasket the pump could fail next week and you will have to pull it again).Hope this helps.

136,114682,How to fix a GE garbage disposal? suddenly stopped grinding; only hums now,"For all of these, you are trying to reach the mechanism and move it back and forth to clear up a jam. Motor hums but there is no grinding.Turn the power off to the disposal for safety while doing these. You wouldnt want it to kick back on you or shock you.There may be a hex nut that you can reach from the top using a socket, extension and breaker bar.There is a special wrench made for reaching inside and grabbing onto the blades for applying turning power. See if these can be rented from a hardware or plumbing shop.Two short (2') sections of broom handle, put in through the top and jamming up against the impeller blades, then crossed from above to provide a pivot, will let you apply torgue (turning force) to the grinding mechanism.If those methods don't work for you, you may have to drop the disposal and work on it on a bench.In terms of cost of labor, if it's not a fast and simple fix it's usually more cost effective to replace a garbage disposal than it is to repair one, especially when replacing with the same brand. Within brands the plumbing, electrical and mounting collar are usually the same and with all these going for you they can usually be replaced in 20 minutes or less."

138,45238,how to unclog a toilet? ,"[taken verbatim from ehow]For more info and many tips from people with the same problem.. follow the link at the source. I hope it helps!1.   Use the toilet as little as possible once you notice there's a problem. This will help prevent overflow and water damage.    2.   Insert a plunger into the toilet, making sure the rubber globe or cup is fully seated over the drain opening.    3.   Push down on the plunger handle with firm but careful strokes. Rough, careless use can damage the toilet bowl. If the clog isn't too tight, these bursts of increased water pressure will probably clear the obstruction.    4.   Attack tougher problems with a snake (see ""eHow to Use a Plumber's Snake').    5.   Consider a drain cleaner only as a last resort. Make sure that any product used is specifically marked as safe for use with porcelain, and follow the manufacturer's directions carefully. Never mix any of these chemical agents, as dangerous reactions could occur.    6.   Flush the toilet several times to remove the drain cleaner and to check the flow."

There is no way to replace the oil in them so u just have to replace the shock. AFter you hit a bump does you truck bounce once or twice then stop and smooth out or does it keep bouncing and eventually stop? your suspension should only cycle once or twice after you go over a dip or bump then the shock should be able to stop it and smooth it out. IF it is not then it has lost too much oil and is getting soft. The wander doesnt really sound like shocks though. That sounds like the steering stabilizer is shot.

Then gently set the new toilet on the flange with the nuts through the base and carefully tighten them down. Not too tight, follow the directions that come with the flange/wax seal.

Best thing to do is plug in an OBDII Scanner (if you have one) to see whats wrong with the vehicle (if anything). I know most Advance Auto Parts & Auto Zones will do this for free. Swing in & tell then your check engine light is on. They should be able to tell you why its on & turn it off for you unless there is an active issue that requires repair & will only turn the light back on. Forgot to mention, Disconnecting the battery for a few minutes & reconnecting should also turn it off. It will come back on if there is an issue that requires repair as stated above. Best bet is to get it checked out."

Fabrize works somewhat, but it doesn't clean.","Most of the time a capret extractor is used to clean upholstery, but you should NOT do this! If you get it too wet, the glue that attaches your upholstery to the roof will loosen, and then you'll have a real mess. Using a spray bottle with warm water, very lightly mist a small area, and then apply a capret cleaner. Gently blot the area with a damp rag. Then blot or air dry. For stubborn stains, you can use a sponge or a brush, but don't scrub the area too hard. As far as the nicotine smell, you can purchase automotive-sized air purifiers that really do a nice job on nicotine.

156,68849,"How do you remove glass shower doors and railings on a bath tub? I need to remove the two sliding glass doors (they ride on wheels on the top) and, if possible, the metal railings on the top,bottom, and sides. I have noticed the railings and support bars have a gummy glue-like substance, which I assume is to help seal it and keep it in place.This is to make it easier to give my baby a bath in the tub. I don't need the doors for now.Any advice is appreciated. Thanks.","The glass doors ride on wheels in a track on the top rails. They are removed typically by holding onto the door and then lifting the wheels out of the track and the doors come off. Sometimes they are just riding in a track and you can lift them straight up and out, and sometimes there are smaller holes in the track that you have to line the wheels up with in order to get them out. If you take off the doors you might not have to take off the rails if it is OK with the rails in place (and then you can put the doors back when the baby grows up!)Once you take the doors off then you can see how the rails are affixed to the tub/wall. Typically there will be screws on the end of the rail that extend into the wall (typically the bottom rail isn't screwed into the tub). Take the screws out. The top rail should come off pretty much when you take out the screws. The bottom rail also has silicone sealant on it. You can carefully cut away the biggest parts of the silicone to get the bottom rail off. Then you can carefully scrape off the remaining silicone.Hope this helps. All in all not a difficult job, although tedious getting the silicone sealant off."
157,98760,how do you read a natural gas meter? ,"If you are looking at your gas meter, you should see four dials straight in a row. Pay close attention to the numbers on the dial and the rotation of the pointer. The first dial should be read counterclockwise. Record the number the pointer has just passed. For example, if the pointer is between the number 4 and the number 5, for dial one, the number would be 4 (counterclockwise dial, the number the pointer just passed). The second dial should be read clockwise. Record the number the pointer just passed. For example, if the pointer is between the number five and the number 6, for dial number two, the number would be 5. The third dial is read exactly like the first, counterclockwise and the number the pointer has just passed. The fourth dial is read clockwise, but this time record the number the pointer is nearest. To determine how much gas you have consumed this month, record your meter reading today. Then come back one month from today and record your meter reading again. Then subtract last's months reading from this month's reading to calculate how many ccf's of gas you've used."

159,111938,"How do u change the slave cylinder on a 96 Honda Passport? I guess that is what is wrong.  It has used a little fluid about once every 2 weeks, and now it has went to maybe 2 days.  Is it in the transmission?","Well...  I hope you're talking about clutch (brake) fluid.  If so it will not be an internal transmission problem.  There is really only one of 3 things it can be: the master cylinder, slave cylinder, or the line itself.  Check the line for leaks and the slave as well.  If there is only fluid near the slave or no fluid at all it is probably the slave, but replacing a slave can sometimes cause the master to go out a short time later.  On a Honda, to just buy a master is probably expensive so I would just change the slave.  Just don't kill me if you replace your slave and find its the master.  You may need them both replaced, and if this is the case getting a new clean line is best also.To replace the slave, you should first loosen the line and let the fluid drain.  Try to pin the line up to prevent all the fluid from draining, but if not we'll bleed it anyway.  Now loosen the bolts holding the slave cylinder to the transmission and remove.  The push rod on the slave my be connected to the clutch fork somehow, you'll have to figure this part out (I'm not a Honda tech I work on diesels lol).  The inside of the boot may be holding all that fluid so be careful.  You should also notice the mounting of the slave.  Make sure the the bleeder screw is facing up.  THIS IS IMPORTANT AS IF IT DOES NOT FACE UP YOU WILL HAVE TO BLEED IT BEFORE INSTALLATION.  Now insall the slave onto the trans and loosen the bleeder.  Hook up the line (remember line wrench) and Fill master cylinder.  Use DOT 4 brake fluid.  You will see fluid start to flow out of the bleeder (hopefully) and when it is steady close the screw.  You may need to get help for this part.  Have a buddy pump the pedal.  Then tell him to hold it down (all the way) and open and close the bleeder.  Keep the fluid level up and when no more air squirts out it should be bleed.  Bleeding a clutch can be hard, it may take a very long time.  There are also other methods you can use.  If you're unsure I wouldn't do it yourself as you may wind up needing a tow truck.  Hope this helps."

187,49562,"how do I fix my refridgerator? I unplugged it for several minutes and the plugged it back in, but its still not cooling very much.  It is running though.","You must run a refrigerator closed for a considerable period of time (perhaps overnight) to determine if it is cooling properly.  It would help if you placed thermometers in the cooler and freezer so that you have true values.  You should check that the regulator (dial?) is set for very cold, that the door seals are in good shape and that the heat exchanger (coil on the back or underneath) is clean of dirt and dust.  Also, defrost the freezer if there is an ice buildup.  Give the refrigerator the best chance to win before giving up.  Refrigerators work best if they have lots of item in the freezer and cooler (even milk cartons of water for a test).  If the unit is still under warranty, call for service.  You may have a bad compressor if there is no cooling effect or a bad thermostat to regulate temperature.  The unit should cycle on and off if it is cooling properly.  The age of the machine should help dictate whether you have it repaired (off warranty) or replace it.  Good luck."

197,56729,How to set tile? ,"I f you take your time and are particular to make a good job tiling is remarkably easy, just remember to tack a level wooden batten to the wall for your first tile to sit on and then when the wall is tiled remove the batten and tile in the space below, the reason for this is that no room is square and it looks really bad if you end up with a sliver of tile or a gap filled with grout, so always space your tiles first see how it looks and then start with a half tile on the horizontal and vertical, never ever start with a full tile, as if you start with a half you can make your tiles go bigger and smaller with the wall, try to make sure that where the tile edges meet each other they are fairly level( if they are not just pull the tile out where necessary) and not dipping in or proud of each other as you dont want any brown edges of the tiles showing through the grout having said that grouting hides a multitude of sins,clean off any adhesive as soon as possible, take special care and after a day grout it, only do small sections at a time say two foot square as grout sets quick on a dry joint, when you have grouted a small area then take a grouting tool or the round end of a pencil will do and rub the joints, clean with a almost dry sponge then rub joints again filling in any pin holes then clean again, repeat for the rest of the wall. If the wall is very bad, before you tile you could always level the wall with plasterboard or some waterproof equivalent. Always use waterproof adhesive and grout,  .im not a tiler I am a plasterer but recently have been doing a fair bit of tiling and although a little slow and fussy I have been delighted with the results its much easier than you might think."

202,67336,how do i repair a large hole in drywall?  what tools should i use? ,"Several methods here depending on the size of the hole. Smaller holes can be patched with pre-mixed sheet rock mud. Sounds like youve got a bigger problem. If the hole is really big, cut the sheetrock so that the hole is rectangular. Cut, from a new piece of sheet rock you got from your favorite home improvement center, a ""patch"" that is approximately 1"" bigger than the hole on all four sides. Use construction adhesive to glue the patch from the backside into the hole. You may need to hold this patch in place with sheetrock screws around the edges. When that's dry (give it some time!) cut another piece that just fits the hole, about an 1/8"" smaller on all sides. Glue that over the backing you put in. Let that dry. Use sheetrock tape and mud to finish off the seams. Sand, texture and paint to match. This isn't a difficult project. You need a sharp knife, straight edge, some sheetrock, sheetrock mud, sheetrock tape, construction adhesive, sheetrock screws, screw driver, canned texture, sand paper, paint and a 4"" - 6"" putty knife. Let everything dry before moving on to the next step."

210,93327,how do i fix smelly pipes? ,"If you are talking about plumbing pipes you shouldn't be able to smell them because there is supposed to be a trap in all drains which keeps water in it at all times unless it hasn't been used in a long time and the water has evaporated.There is supposed to be a vent on all drains and the water in the trap makes the sewer gas and odor go up the vent instead of into the house.If you have drains that haven't been used in a while run some water in them.If this doesn't work and you have a garbage disposal then that is probably where the odor is coming from.I personally don't like them,mainly because of odor problems and they can help to clog your pipes."

212,17051,How to replace a piece of carpet? I had left an iron box on the stair case and it burnt that part. Whats the best way to handle it.,"A nasty stain or unsightly hole doesn't have to ruin the whole carpet. Patch it.       Steps:  1.   Cut out the entire damaged area with a utility knife. Try to do this with just one cut on each side and avoid cutting through the carpet pad.    2.   Use the cut-out piece as a pattern to cut a new piece. Be sure to match the direction of the pile.    3.   Spread carpet adhesive on the exposed carpet pad and on the back of the patch itself.    4.   Put some adhesive under the edges of the carpet surrounding the hole as well.    5.   Press the patch into the hole and rough up the pile with your fingertips.    6.   Let the glue dry for about six hours and then vacuum the patched area.        Tips:   If you accidentally cut the carpet pad, fasten it down with a piece of wide duct tape.     If you don't happen to have extra matching carpet, get a remnant at a carpet store. Take your damaged piece with you when you go to the store to help you find a good match.     Use a sharp blade in the utility knife for the best cut.  http://www.ehow.com/how_8256_patch-hole-carpet.html"
213,62862,how do i stop water from seeping into my basement? ,"There are two typical non-utility sources:1. the ground around your house does not shed water away from the foundation.2. the groundwater table is high.I have found that most instances the problem is the first one.  Usually the least expensive method to be re-grading the yard to keep water away from the house.  Occasionally you may need to excavate to the foundation slab, and apply a good waterproofing such as an asphalt compound. Customarily, home builders throw trash, such as lunch litter and wood scraps, along the foundation walls before the backfill is placed.  In addition to natural settlement of the ground around a home, when the trash decays, or collapses, the ground settles further.  When gutters overflow, this area holds water which can easily get inside unless the walls were waterproofed to swimmingpool standards.I recommend pulling back the top 4-6"" of soil from around the house by as much as 6 - 8 feet out.  Get some clay soil and place a wedge of it with the thickest part near the house. Pack the clay down good. Then re-grade the top soil back, and plant. the end result will be that the ground around the foundation is higher than the remainder of the yard.  It will also be important to have the yard graded to get positive drainage moving the rainwater further away. A Landscape Architect can help you with this.  Then be sure to get the down-spouts pointed away from the house."

If you damaged the threads in the cylinder heads than you may beable to use a tap and fix the threads but more likly you will need to get somthing I would use called a Helicoil. You can get them at your local auto parts store. If you are feeling lucky you can do it while the head is on the engine but for best results you should remove the head from the engine. There is a special tap that is made to cut the threads from the inside out so you can tap the holes without removing the head from the motor. The tap goes down small so you can put it all the way down in the hole then expand it out so you can cut the threads. I hope this was helpful. good luck.

Hi, I've been using a 1 hp jet pump(for the past 7 years)for lifting water from the shallow well to the overhead tank.I've been experiencing lot of problems due to the excessive hardness of the well water & my motor strucks many times.But this time it is not the problem due to hardness of water.My pump does not starts very often(for example, if I put this evening,it works but the next day it is not starting at all) .When I checked the capacitor(keltron 12.5 MFD 440VAC 50 Hz),it is ok & the coil is not burnt.This time I didn't want to spend more for the technician & removed the capacitor(myself) & checked & refixed it,to my surprise it worked for 3days & again the pump is not running(there is no jam in the impeller).Again I did the same thing as I did before but the pump is not running.My question is what will be the other reasons for the pump not running if capacitor is good & the coil is not burnt & there is no jam in the impeller)","man, these kinds of intermittent problems can be so frustrating.  i like it better when things break and stay broken - at least you know if you do something and it works, the thing you did fixed the problem, and it didn't just fix itself.anyway is the motor sitting outside or somewhere that the temperature varies a lot from day to night?i used to work at a lab where a lot of equipment was in sheds where the air was just the same as the outside temperature.  sometimes these things would malfunction only at night or only during the daytime - it was because the circuitry was thermally cycled for a long time, and the variations in temperatures makes the circuit components expand and contract.  that repeated expansion and contraction can cause the solder joints and wires to weaken where they are under mechanical stress, and sometimes crack.these cracks can be very hard to track down, because they are so small and because the problem is intermittent.  so maybe you have the same problem where you leave it outside overnight and the circuit cools and contracts, opening up the connection - then it doesn't start until it warms up again and you get in there and wiggle it around.if i were you i would get in there with a multimeter and check to make sure that your connections are still good.  i suspect something is loose and when you take the cap out to check it, you wiggle whatever the loose thing is.  it could be a problem with one of the capacitor leads if messing with the cap fixed it.also, you may already know this, but a 440V 12mF capacitor can store quite a bit of energy - even if you unplug the motor when you work on it, the capacitor can still give you a very serious electric shock, particularly if you have wet hands or even damp skin, which you might if you are messing with a water pump.  so make sure to discharge the cap by making electrical contact between the two terminals with a bleeder resistor, before you touch anything, and let it discharge for a while.  a capacitor that size can be pretty dangerous.good luck!"

The spark plug has an insulated passageway for this high voltage to travel to the electrode, where it can jump the gap and create a spark,  similar to a bolt of lightning. This ignites the compressed fuel/air mixture, causing the expanding gases to force the piston down. This process converts the chemical energy stored in the fuel to mechanical energy."

251,105502,How can I get a toilet unclogged? We have tried using a plunger and nothing it working.  It flushed but now it is just overflowing.  Thanks!,"How to Unclog a ToiletUnclogging a toilet is not exactly the most entertaining way to spend a day, but it's something we all have to face at one point or another in our lives. When you're renting a place, the worst case scenerio is that you have to have maintenance come and fix your clog. But when you're a homeowner, you definitely want to avoid having a plumber come over.So, after several days of battling toilets in my house and searching the web for unique techniques, here are my three Ping-certified recommended steps to unclogging your toilet: Plunge... First, you obviously want to use your plunger to try and loosen any clogs. Start by making a seal over the hole-in-the-bowl with the plunger. Push down slowly and pull back quickly. Start by doing this at a slow pace and then working up speed. Use a toilet snake/auger... I dislike this step because it can scrape the porcelein, but it's necessary if the plunger doesn't do the job. Make sure you get a toilet snake/auger, as a sink snake/auger will scrape the porcelein on your toilet. Trust me. Work the snake as far back into the hole as possible, trying to dislodge any tissue or solid matter (mmmm... tasty). Pour a bucket of water... If the snake still doesn't let you flush the toilet successfully, this is what finally did it for me. This step can also be used before the plunger in the case of a very small clog, but works well as a last step with a stubborn clog. Get a normal sized bucket and fill it between 1/8 and 1/4 of the way full with warm water. When the water in the toilet is at its lowest point (usually with clogged toilets, very little water is left in the bottom), pour the water directly into the hole-in-the-bowl from about waist-high. The pressure of the water being poured into the bowl does a surprisingly good job at disloding the remaining clog. You may need to repeat this step once or twice."

LEAKS,Im A plumber so here is you answer.Its hard to answer You didnt say where it was leaking.A quick run down You have a fill valve/  Douglas Valve/Flapper/Tank to bowl gasket with bolts and a wax ring with or without horn.1st dry off the WC (water closet=Toilet) and try to find out where the water is from2nd if its on the floor then its is the wax ring. Remove the supply line and bolts and replace the wax ring. if its where the bowl and tank meet then its the tank to bowl gasket set (3.99 Home depot) Remove bolts and gasket and replace. TIP when putting the new bolts on use plumbers dope on rubber washers to make a good seal also put Dope on gasket and tank and bowl for good seal. If its from there area where the supply line is going in thats the fill valve. Most WC have a valve with a rod and long ball on the end. DO not replace it with the same one Go to Home depot and Get A fluid master 400a And replace. And supply line check connections if bad then replace.3 other things could be a hair line crack in tank or bowl.also the flapper. inside the WC best way to check use some food coloring from the kitchen put 5 or so drops in the tank stir up a bit in 20 min or so if you used red and the water in the bowl is red then flapper is bad but this could also mean The seal or unit its on is bad. Replace. (this is also a good thing to do at 1st use the color red or blue and where you see it is where the problem is.but last WC= will sweet the temp of the water and the temp outside if there is a certain change it will sweet. You can fix it will a liner in the tank. Home depot again.But with all this info you might have a Kohler 1 PC wc and some of this does not even apply I wish you could have gave some more info on the unit. How old what kind and where you think its from the leak I mean.So Since you need help if you would like you can e-mail me with this info and I would be glad to help you out.

A simple fix would be great if any of you know of one.Thanks,Ted",Well since you live in a Apartment building The only thing you can really do is Pull back the carpet And Mark the floor joist with a chalk lineThen use 2 1/2 deck locking screws every 6 inches or so This will pull the flooring down to the studs. also If any nails are sticking up hammer them in. This is the best way to fix this problem since you in a apartment. If you lived in a house and had a basement you could fix it from the bottom. since this is not the case this is all you can do. Call a carpet guy out to pull back the carpet off the tack strip (or do that yourself) do this to the floor and Call the Carpet guy back to kick the carpet back into place. Try to do this when the person you live above or below is not home it will make some noise. The carpet guy wont cost much.Also where you hear the noise start there with the screws after you put in 30 or so walk the floor untill the noise is gone. after the noise is gone put a screw in every 12 to 16 inches past the part where the noise stopped. this will make sure the noise did not travel and will slao stop it from moving down the hall or somewhere else..Happy screwing..LOLI had to write back to this ? and the 1 answer You dont want to cut the carpet If you do this the landlord can make you pay for new carpet. @nd make sure you find the joist if you do not find them and you drive a 3 inch screw into the floor and no joist you could hit a water line or elec.

Just get a squirt bottle and keep squirting the seals with fuel and keep it wet for as long as possible. You can feel with your fingernail that it's starting to get softer. Best thing about it is, it has zero effect on the inner safety lining of the glass.

278,76906,how to remove popcorn ceiling? ,"Use an everyday spray bottle and spray water on the popcorn.  Start in a small section in the most hidden corner of the room becasue there is a slight learning curve to this.  Once you spray and saturate the popcorn, use a putty knife (1"" in detail areas, up to 6"" in large areas) and attempt to scrape off the popcorn.  DO NOT OVERWET OR OVERSCRAPE AT FIRST! Start with minimal water and scraping and increase from there.  The goal is to scrape off the texture (popcorn) and not the drywall paper (if it is in fact drywall behind it, some older homes may have a different backing than drywall). Make sure you wear eye protection and something to prevent you from inhaling the dust and/or particles.

292,77360,how to install vinyl soffit and facia? i am building a garage and am to this point should this step be done before i put the siding on or should i wait,"Installing Vinyl Siding - Making It Simple by Colin McDougall Installing vinyl siding can be a very rewarding process that could dramatically change the appearance of your home. For the most part, if you plan your job well and adhere to some simple guide lines, anyone could learn how to install siding to there home. The first thing to consider when installing vinyl siding is what tools will be needed for the job. Basically with some common carpenter tools, like a, hammer, level, chalk line, screw driver set, tin snips and a good circular saw you can pretty much achieve what it is you need to do. But if you plan on making a profession out of it, expect to pay in the thousands for a properly equipped truck. After you have gathered your tools, you will need to collect your materials to prepare the job. Below you will find a list of some fundamental items needed to start your siding project. Sheathing/BackerboardVinyl siding should be applied over a sheathing that provides a smooth, flat surface. Since every district has different code requirements you may want to consult local building codes for sheathing requirements. Vinyl siding should never be applied directly to framing studs without sheathing. As an alternative to backer board, there is a variety of specific types of contoured foam under lays available for various styles of vinyl siding. Weather Resistant BarrierVinyl siding should be installed over a continuous weather resistant barrier to stop the intrusion of incidental water. Weather resistant barrier systems commonly consist of a combination of exterior cladding, flashed wall openings and penetrations, weather resistant barrier material, and sheathing. Commonly used is black carpentry felt. When using felt be sure to check thickness requirements. Flashing Code-compliant flashing should be integrated with the weather resistant barrier and applied around windows, doors, and other openings. Flashing should also be applied to inside and outside corners, and the intersection of walls and roofing to prevent water seepage through the joints. Once your outside wall has been covered with sheathing to provide a smooth flat surface, and your windows and doors have had flashing installed to channel any incidental water from collecting, you may now install the starter strip. This strip is an accessory applied directly to the surface of the building at the lowest part of the wall to be sided, and is used to secure the first course of siding to the home. This course will need to be checked for level as it is what the rest of the job relies upon for evenness. With aluminum, galvanized steel, or other corrosion-resistant nails, you may now start installing the vinyl siding. As each style of panel may be different refer to installation instructions supplied. Cut the panels to length with a circular saw and trim with tin snips. As you nail the panels in place, be sure to leave about the thickness of as dime between the nail head and wall to allow for shifting. Check every 5th or 6th course for horizontal alignment. When portions overlap you must have about 1"" to seal the joint. The basic installation of vinyl siding is quite simple, but since there are codes governing how certain aspects are handled, you should inquire with a professional for specific trimming tasks and other more complicated vinyl siding installation practices. All in all, you will find the task of re-siding your home manageable with only a few frustrations to contend with. But the reward will be well worth it.

294,90632,How can i define trouble codes that are retreved from vechicle dianogstic machine? my vechicle is showing a check engine light i found the code but dont know what it mean,"If you are good friends with a technician at a local repair center (or if you are good at becoming good friends with people quickly) they may help you out for next to nothing. Some libraries (especially in collage towns) have a version of electronic service information available to the public. You can also take a trip down to your local auto parts store and purchase a Chilton or Haynes manual for around $20, these manuals are limited in the information they give you but they have descriptions of DTC’s (Diagnostic Trouble Codes). From there you can do your pin-point tests to determine the root cause of the problem that set the code. Additionally, there are vast sources on the internet for such information. A simple search could help you determine what the number means; however to properly diagnose the problem, you are going to need access to a bit more than what is available for free on the internet. All Data has a service available that allows you to access the same information shops have for a small fee. And, if you are looking for guidance in repairing the problem yourself, I myself can assist you VIA e-mail. I am in the process of setting up a small internet business unlike any other I have come across, where I walk people through problems with their vehicles for a small fee—cheaper than going to a shop or misdiagnosing and buying unneeded parts, yet enough to make it worth my while to do every night. If you are interested in my assistance (free for now) email me at the address I have in the source section (it isn't a link, type it in replacing the word ""at"" with the symbol and no spaces) Please note that I don’t have direct access to service information at this time; however, I can make a phone call to one of my old tech school instructors to obtain information for you, it just might take a couple of days—longer if I need to have flow-charts and such sent. I hope this helps!"

Also, my Mom's car has so much moisture in her car that on cold mornings, there is frost build up on the inside of the windshield that can actually be removed with an ice-scraper !!! The floors and seats in the car aren't damp anymore (well at least not to the touch), yet there is excessive moisture build up in both cars. Please help. I feel like the only a scientist could come up with a solution...haven't had any luck with anyone else. Thank you.","Has both cars been in a flood?Even though you don't feel the carpet wet any longer, it's possible the carpet padding (under the carpet) is still damp and causing moisture--you should be able to lift one of the corners of the carpet and feel for any dampness--try and get to the lowest point if possible.If this is the case, you will have to remove the seats and interior items, remove the carpet and either replace the padding (you should be able to get similar padding at a local parts house) or simply leave it out.Jerry Christopherhttp://www.usedcarwise.com"

361,99786,How can I tell how much clutch life my clutch has left?  Or what % of life is left? 05 Subaru WRX. No distinct problems yet such as a slipping clutch. But I am curious because I'm running an upgraded turbo with quite a bit more torque.,"Usually I can tell how much my clutch is worn by how far the clutch pedal comes off of the floor before it engages with the flywheel.  The more it wears, the closer to the top of its stroke it will be before the clutch pedal engages.  Also, you will lose free play in your clutch.  Free play is when you can  feel that the clutch pedal is easy to push towards the floor, before you feel resistance. The resistance is the clutch starting to release from the flywheel.  The free play will get less and less as your clutch wears."

363,44676,how to install an aftermarket radio in a 1997 ford taurus sho? ,"if you want factory wiring along with your new aftermarket radio, then you need wiring harness adapter that go along with the type of stero you got.  that way you dont have to cut into any wire which you have no clue of.  that would be the easliest way to get it done.  if you prefer to save some money without buying the adapter, then you need to cut into the factory wiring.  for that 1st need to know which wires are for power. 2nd which are for speakers.  most people think power is usually red but can be different or a mixture of different colors. instead of assume which wire is which.  do it with a multimeter, that would help without burning the fuses.  identify which are speaker wires.  move them aside, you are left with power, ground, antennna etc.  to find the power that mean +12vdc, hook up the meter with black probe touching the chasis or the car.  with key on engine off, the red probe of the meter would be use to test out which is the hot wire.  you would go through the few wires until you know which one is which is +12vdc.  once you get power, ground, antenna figure out, then everything else is easy.  hope that helps"
364,18402,How can I change out the kitchen sink in a granite counter top? ,"The problem with changing a sink, even if it is ""standard size"" is that there are many small variations from manufacturer to manufacturer. The granite may no longer match the outlines of the new sink. (corner radius may differ slightly.)  If you're set on a new sink, try to get the same manufacturer, some offer different materials in the same style sink.  Now we're getting really tricky because the ganite is seamed right at the sink. Those ""arms"" that reach out to the sink from either side are the weakest spot. If you're not careful, you may break them off when trying to cut the seal between the sink and granite. I'm assuming that the sink was sealed with silicone when it was installed. What you're going to have to do is:remove the faucetremove ALL the plumbing from under that sink (clearance issues when removing)remove the sink clipscut the silicone seampull out the sinkreverse the processSome things to think about, #1 The sink may not fit between the cabinet doors.  As a granite installer for years, I'm  surprized at the number of times the sink will not fit in the doors, the only way to install it was drop it in from above and then put the granite in place on top.  This happens a lot. #2 possiblility, the sink may be resting on the cabinet frame, in that case, the top has to be removed before the sink can be taken out. #3 there may not be enough room to fit your hands under the sink to cut the silicone seal. This then has to be done from above. Easier, but still have to think about it. Good Luck!"

372,136834,How can I get rid of the musty smell coming out of my cars AC.? ,"Great automotive questionBut that's a problem that's extremely difficult to solve, at least on a permanent basis.It's caused by the growth of fungi in the ac evaparator case, manufactuers have been faced with this complaint for years. Especially in geographic regions with high humidity and temperatures.There are numerous products on the market that propose to eliminate the odor, but I've never seen one that permanately resolves the smell. Usually they will work for a short period of time and the smell reappears.Most dealerships and some auto repair shops will have a chemical and special tool that is sprayed inside the evaporator core to slow down this fungi growth, and hopefully stop the smell.You may be able to purchase similar products at your local parts house as well, it should come with instructions on how to use.One Important tip--------Using your ac on outside air on a frequent basis will help slow down this condition to some degree. The outside air keeps moisture from building up in the evaporator case, thus preventing the growth of fungi.It will also help the evap case dry if you turn your ac mode on ""outside air"" before shutting off the engine for long periods of time.Jerry Christopherhttp://www.usedcarwise.com"

376,9005,how do I reset the service&#92;check engine light on a 98 ford escort lx&#92;le? ,"Even though the vehicle is under OBDII standards, switch the ignition off, then you can go to the plug in, located under the steering column (usually to the right), remove the cap if there is one, and use a paper-clip, bend the paper-clip into a ""U"" and insert it into the very first two openings, the top and the bottom on the first column. Then switch the ignition back on and watch your check engine light, it should flash ""one"" then ""one, two, three"" indicating 13 that it is being read, it will flash ""13"" 3 times. Then it will flash the code, ""one, two, three"" and ""one, two, three"" would inicate diagnostic trouble code ""33."" It will flash each code 3 times, and then move on to the next code. You'll have to watch the check engine light, and steady look at it, and count how many times is flashes to see what trouble code it is displaying. Then you can lookup ""Diagnostic Trouble Codes"" for your particular vehicle make/model on the internet.Or you can take it to Autozone, and they'll plug it in and check it for you, or any shop or dealership will be able to check it as well.The easiest, and best way to clear the trouble codes is to disconnect the battery cables, you can leave them off for maybe 5 minutes, and it will wipe out the memory. It will also erase the radio presets, which you can easily reset by selecting a station, and holding down the preset number. Most receivers will show memory or programmed or something showing you that the preset has been recorded. However, if the problem has not been rectified, then the light will reappear. So, you can use the paper-clip method or take it to someone who can plug it in, and read the code. It would probably be best to read the code before you clear it, even if it doesnt come back, just to know why it was there."

Shut the circuit off and see if your gfi recepticle goes off and if you are on the line side(before) the gfi you should remove the gfi and put it in the garage and put the regular outlet where the gfi was then you would run the circuit from the breaker box to the load side of the gfi and the line side to the out going wire.

You should never have to remove the pellets that are in there.  If your tank is only 1/5th full, you should add more to fill it back up.  If you are getting contaminates through your tap you will need to install/replace your filter.  Remember, a water softener is not a water filter.  If the contaminates (probably sand) are a permanent problem, than I would install a filter.  If you install it where water first comes to your house from the main, then you are stopping contaminates from the source.  Wait and see if this is a permanent problem though.  New construction in the area or servicing to water mains or hydrants will cause sediment in water mains to come loose and eventually find their way to your taps.  This normally stops."

418,140712,"how do i change an idler pulley? my idler puuley is make noise , how do i change it. I can see it but i cant get to it. I own a 2001 pontiac grand prix","What size engine?You can take the tension off of the belt and spin the pulley.  If it rolls easy and doesn't wobble it might not be the pulley.  There should be a diagram of the belt path someplace under the hood if not note the belt routing (It’s IMPORTANT)Also note that if that belt comes off while you're driving you lose your power steering your water pump alternator etc.Assuming you're still feeling brave and aren't afraid of skinning your knuckles (Oh Yeah you'll do that) Most newer gm engines use a single idler pulley that doubles as the belt tensioner. When you go to the auto parts store they are just going to sell you the pulley itself so you'll have to use the old tensioner arm.Your first step is to get the belt off.  There will be a bolt on the center of the pulley.  Some of these bolts have a reverse thread on them. Put a large wrench of the exact size on the bolt (If you use standard wrench on a metric bolt you'll strip the bolt and hurt your hand, (you were warned....) You have to pull on the wrench to take the tension off of the belt, at the same time pull the belt off of a pulley or two then slowly ease off of the wrench, don't let it slam back.After that just take the pulley bolt out, replace the pulley, reverse the process making sure you follow the belt path.While you're at it check the belt itself this could be the source of your noise and you may want to replace it now.  Also note that if your belt is bad it is most likely time to replace your radiator hoses.You may want to check out your local library for a shop manual for your car.  It will show you lots of pretty pictures ;-)Good Luck."

421,113963,How do you make a homemade drain unblocker (like draino)? ,"The simple ingredients of baking soda and vinegar can unclog drains. Best of all, you're fixing the problem without pouring anything toxic down the drain.   Steps:  1.   Remove contents from sink/tub.  2.   Pour 1/4 cup of baking soda down the drain.  3.   Pour in one cup of vinegar into the drain.  4.   Cover the drain with a lid and wait fifteen minutes. The baking soda and vinegar will have a chemical reaction, breaking down the clog.  5.   Rinse the drain with hot water to clear it out.  6.   Repeat if necessary.        Tips:   You may need to use a plunger to help break the clog.

423,72679,how to drain coolant on a 98 intrigue? ,"And after draining the radiator, I recommend filling it with distilled water and running the engine awhile until the temperature comes up and the thermostat is fully open. Then the coolant that was in the engine will be diluted by the water you added. Then drain it again to get a better flush. You could also add a light duty cleaner after the first drain. When your all done flushing it in this manner, empty the radiator one last time and fill with 100% antifreeze. If you've drained the radiator enough times to have essentially only water in the engine, you'll end up with the desired 50/50 water/antifreeze concentration."

Most doors are either 2/10 or 3/0, that is 34"" or 36"".  Go to the hardware store or home center and buy a sweep that will fit your door.The sweep will usually be slightly wider than your doo so you will need a hacksaw to trim the excess.  Once trimed to size, you place the sweep under your door and mark the hole locations.  Always pre-drill the screw holes.  Now attach the sweep with the provided screws and adjust how far down it goes by opening and closing the door and adjust as needed."
476,105841,how to stop cold air from coming from windows that wasn't properly sealed to keep out air? ,"Long-term solution:1. Caulk the outside window frame, where it meets the house. Caulk all joints and seams in the outside of the window.2. Check the glazing compound inside and out to be sure it is attached to both the glass and frame.3. Caulk the inside joint around the window where it meets the wall. 4. Seal any cracks or seams in the non-moving parts of the window and sashes. 5. Use a weatherseal (I like V-Seal) to line the sides and bottom of the moving sashe, and the joint between the two sashes.That gives you a weather-tight window that will last a long time (depending at least in part on the quality of the caulks and materials), AND saves money in the summer as well.Additional insulation can be provided by outside mounted plastic sheeting, inside mounted shrink film plastic, good curtains, etc."
477,38801,how do I replace the timing belt on a 1986 chevy nova? ,"The Chevy Nova 1986 is basically a 1986 Toyota Corolla and it has a toyota engine in it.I recommend getting an Haynes Manual if you want to do this yourself. It is not an easy task. and unless you are really mechanically inclined I WOULDN'T recommend you do it yourself unless you've got a good manual and a friend who has done a timing belt. Typical steps to replacing a timing belt.1. Disconnect battery.2. Remove all accessory belts. (various means).3. Remove the harmonic balance. (On the crank shaft that was driving all the accessory belts. Usually the hardest part for me of a timing belt change.4. You may have to open the flywheel/flex plate inspection area or remove the starter motor and jam a screw driver into the flex plate to prevent the crank shaft from turning as you try to remove this bolt.5. Remove the timing belt covers. Typically an upper and lower cover.6. If necessary you may have to remove an engine mount as I recall the engine is a transverse mounted engine. If this is the case you'll have to support that part of the engine with a floor jack and preferably a piece of wood or something that won't punch through your oil pan. Or you can use an engine hoist from the top.7. Now align the crank shaft and cam shaft(s) to Top Dead Center (TDC) for cylinder 1. Usually there's marks on both the cam and crank shaft to indicate when you are at TDC.I believe the cam shaft has an arrow on it that must align with an arrow on the housing to indicate TDC.8. Now look for a pulley that is applying pressure to the timing belt, but can be loosened and be pushed against to loosen the timing belt.9. Remove timing belt.10. Install new timing belt.11. Release the tensioning pully so that it is applying tension.12. Tighten the tensioning pully in place.13. VERY IMPORTANT. CHECK to be sure you didn't mess up the synchronization between the cam shaft and crank shaft. So after re-applying the tensioner's pressure. You must try to turn the crank shaft two rotations and check cam shaft location. They should be the same as before. If not, your crank and cam shaft have gotten out of synchronization and you must take the timing belt off and re-sync them.If everything is in sync, then re-install everything in the reverse order.That's the short version of how to do a timing belt. Typically you can get through the entire job with a good ratchet set, a few screwdrivers and a nice set of wrenches. No other speciality tools are typically necessary unless of course you strip a bolt.Good luck."

482,25726,how can i make a quick fix on a exhaust leak without taking it to the shop? ,"I have used Victor's Rockcast Exhaust Repair Kit with success. It works like the old plaster casts a doctor used to put on broken limbs. The kit comes with a roll of cloth tape with the ""plaster"" embedded. You cut it into strips and wet it with a solution of water and hardener. It stays soft long enough to wrap it around the damaged pipe/muffler, then hardens to full strength over a period of hours. It's not a permanent repair, but is useful in a pinch. This page at Victor Automotive shows this as well as several other exhaust repair products. Autozone, Advance, etc stock these. http://www.victorautomotive.net/pdfs/vic/ver2.pdfJB Weld is a good product, too. For small holes, it would probably be your best bet. Any hardware or auto parts store and discount stores like WalMart sell JB Weld. http://jbweld.net/index.phpWhatever you use, the repair will last a lot longer if you make sure the area where you're gonna apply anything is clean."

486,50812,how to quickly remove scaling deposits from inside a electric hot water tank? ,1st althought the first answer is ok. There are some things you need to know.ACID will wear the tank even A little bit will do this.I have been a plumber for 20yrs and I wish you would have said if it was on a well or city water but anyways.there is not real way to get into the tank and scrape it.And I dont know how handy you are but if you arego to your local plumbing supply house and ask them for descaler Tell them what your doing they will know what you need.Shut the water and elec off to the tank and remove the cold pipe from the tank.Pull out the dip tude its about 36inchs or so Depending on what kind you have.Get a 4tf Pc pf copper and drill holes in the pipe only on 3 ft of the pipe SMALL HOLES about 50 to 6o of them.Buy the connector so you can hook up to a hoseAnd buy A good size funnelDrain the HWT at the bottom there is a hose bib open it and drain in.( at the local HD store buy a drill pump About 5 bucks it comes with 2 pc of 5 foot hosesMix the product you got from the dealer mix with water Put a 2 gallon bucket under hose bib pour mix into funnel (funnel is in top of copper pipe u slide into the cold side of tank.With the small pump 1 side of the hose in the bucket 1 side in the funnel Use cordless drill and start the drill up. This will cause the pump to move the mix in 1 big circel And it will shoot out all the little holes in the copper pipe. do this for 5 min wait 20 min and do this again. When you are done hook up hose to pipe and turn on the hose and wash the tank really good to remove any acid in the tank or dirt. then put back together.This is a little bit of work though. And if your tank has this problem then your pipes do too.You should have your water tested and see if a filter system could help you out or a softner. ( Things like this keep money in my pocket this is a common problem) But when a tank gets to a point like this  and its bad Its better to change the tank check the water and do what you can like a filter ect.(( Always remember with any HWT if its a well system every 3 months to 6 months Hook up a hose to the hose bib on the bottom of the tank and turn it on this will cause water to rush into the tank and out the hose when clear water comes out of the hose its clean.MOST Hwts that go bad is cause so much dirt is in the bottom of the tank and it had ate its way through the tank.A little bit of maintiance will save you 1000's in the long run.Also Do you know for sure this is what is in your tank? Alot of times homeowners think this is what it is and its not. Make sure you know what it is before you try to correct the problem.If you need more info and would like my help drop me a line at kos101@yahoo.comGoodluck

If I can do it myself, I'd rather than wait for the phone compnay.","If you have a Network Interface box, open it and make sure the connectors are plugged in.  If they're already plugged in and you still have no phone service in the house, follow the wiring into the house and look for a connector or wire junction. This will either have plug-in connectors or blade-type push-in connectors for the wires. Check to be sure that the connectors or wires are attached.One caution - if the jacks weren't professionally wired, there may be a short in one of them, causing all the jacks not to work.  You'll have to find a problem like that by the process of elimination.  Choose one jack and examine the wiring to it.  If it checks okay, disconnect all the jacks BUT that one, then test it. If it works, reconnect the other jacks one at a time until they stop working. The last one connected will be the bad one :)"

Ours is empty, and someone said the floor won't be strong enough for us to turn it into a living space, or to even store anything heavy in there.  How do I find out without risking anyone or anything crashing through the ceiling?","Try locating the drawings for your home.  We (Florida) are required to keep residential plans on file for 15 years.  Hopefully, your truss engineering would be included in those plans.You can very easily get an opinion from a licensed architect or engineer with your truss engineering.If it was conventionally framed (i.e. 2x6 or 2x8's) then you need the span distance, your first floor construction criteria and your footer design.  Not to knock calling a contractor, but I would run the information by a licensed architect or engineer.  They would have to provide you sealed drawings for your permit anyway. (Sorry, maybe not where you live but in Florida for sure.)I would not do anything with the space if you are unsure.  If the space was not designed for attic storage, nevermind a habitable living space - the end result, such as a collapse may not even be covered by your home owners insurance if you don't do it properly.Maybe contact your local building official, perhaps they would answer a question or two.Best of luck!"

507,25080,how do you change a bit out on a craftsman wood router? ,"Depends on the router.  Some have a lock mechanism to lock the shaft and disable the power switch.  Some you have to use two wrenches.  In either case, you will need a box end wrench to loosen the collett that holds the bit.  As you are looking at the business end of the router, the collett needs to rotate counter-clockwise to loosen the bit.  If the bit is still stuck, you will need to get a pair of pliers to GENTLY pull the bit out of the chuck using as light a pressure as you can.  If you have soft jawed pliers, that would be perfect.  You don't want to squeeze the bit so hard, the carbide chips or cracks.  As you are pulling on the bit, keep the shaft in the locked position and pull and rotate gently.  If the bit is still stuck, remove the collett completely and use a flat bladed screw driver to gently pry apart the flutes in the chuck.  Be patient, be gentle.  You can also look on the Sears website for an owners manual for your specific router."

513,10805,How to check codes on a 1990 Honda Accord? CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON AFTER I REPLACED THE COIL FOR A NO SPARK CONDITION. NOW THE CAR RUNS BUT THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT COMES ON AND THE CAR SPUTTERS ONCE IN A WHILE WHEN SOFT ACCELERATING. HOW DO I READ THE CODES?,"The ECU is located on the front floor, about under the passenger's toes. Pull the carpet down; a large protective cover will be seen over the ECU. On the upper edge of the cover is a window or opening, allowing the Light Emitting Diode (LED) to be viewed. Turn the ignition ON, but do not start the engine. The LED should begin to flash. NOTE: In the event that a code is encountered which is not on the chart, re-count the number of flashes. If the code is truly wrong, it will be necessary to swap the ECU for a known-good unit and recheck. Since this can be expensive, you may wish to bring the car to a reputable repair facility if no other cause of the failure can be found. This may save you the expense of purchasing an unnecessary part. Once the codes are read, refer to the appropriate troubleshooting chart for testing procedures. Note that some tests will require the Honda test harness. (Use harness No. 07HAZ-PJ7010A and 07HAZ–PH7000A for 1988–89 and 07LAJ–PT30100 for 1990). This is a device which allows safe testing of the electrical circuits without backprobing connectors. It installs between the ECU and the wiring harnesses. This is a specialty item, usually only available from dealers.

517,73672,How to stop a noisy drain from kitchen sink?. It makes a popping noise when the water s draining from the sink ,ok there are only a few things that can cause this1st the sink can be clogged if this is the case rent a snake and run the line if you want to hire someone to do this it will run about 61 bucks for a KS line2nd To me it sounds like a vent problemThe reason for a vent is when the water is draining down the line air comes down the vent pipe behind the water to make it flow faster and to make sure it makes it too the main line. If the vent is blocked you will get a popping noise or a gur-gul sound from the drain.If there is no Vent on the line you can always install a In-Line vent or a Studer vent.To check the vent you could get on the roof with a gallon of water and pour in down the vent and listen for the flow of water if it sounds good and clear then the line has a clog or a belly in the line.Most KS Lines have alot of grease in the line and It builds up Like little mountians in the line so when the water drains it goes up and down up and down and it could make a noise like water hitting a small dam in the line. so only 2 things it could be1 Clog or small clog2 Vent Problem

521,136822,how do you hook up or phone to your computer? ,"If you already have a phone jack in the back of your computer, then the above user is correct.  If you do not, there may be several approaches to solving your problem.First you need a modem.  If you want to use the computer to answer the phone, save and play voice mail, etc. then all you need is a data/fax/voice modem.  They are installed as a PCI card in an available slot in your computer, and provide a phone jack for the physical connection.  They usually include software for sending and receiving faxes, voicemail, and receiving and making voice calls.  You will need a microphone and speakers, or headset (easier to use)Here is an example of a PCI fax/data/voice modem: http://www.compusa.com/products/product_info.asp?product_code=50179302&pfp=BROWSEIf you want to connect your phone line to your computer for internet access, a PCI fax/data/voice modem will work, but is very slow.  You can also connect to the internet via your phone using a DSL modem.  DSL uses wires in your phone line but does not prevent you from making or receiving calls on your house line.  DSL is also much faster than ""dial-up"" internet access using the PCI fax/data/voice modem.For connecting a DSL modem, you will need a 10/100 Ethernet PCI card instead of the PCI fax/data/voice modem.Well, I hope this helps.  There may be other ways to do this, such as Modems with USB connections, etc.  but i am not sure about those.Good Luck.-Neil"

537,139274,how do I remove a hot water radiator? ,"Shut down your boiler then you'll have to drain the system below the lowest part of the radiator you want to remove. If your lucky there might be shut off valves specific to the radiator that can be closed to avoid draining the entire system. Use due caution with these valves. If they don't hold all of the water above you will be ON YOU fairly quickly. Next   you'll need to break the unions on the piping. For this you'll need a couple of 18 or 24"" pipe wrenches and some strength depending how old it is. Remove everything back to the pipe nipple and close it up with some pipe caps.I'm not sure what your skill level or ambition is but this can turn into a headache pretty quick if you were to break a fitting or had an issue isolating your system. Even if everything goes smooth you'll still need a couple of friends to move the radiator if it's cast iron 'cause they weigh a ton. Good Luck."

542,127811,how can I determine why  my hydrojet water heater is not working? ,"The heater is probley electric so I would first check the fuse/circuit breaker box to see if the fuse/circuit breaker is tripped. If the fuse box is okay then you will need to access the heater and open the panel there the electric wires coming in. Using a amp meter, test to see if amprage is being drawn through the wires to the heating element. If no amp's are being drawn then the element is possibly burnt out. However the tempature control circuit may not be sending a signal to the control relay to turn on the element. Check the tempature control circuit board to see the thermocouple is connected and the boards output relay is energized using a volt meter. If there is no voltage output from the circuit board to the heater element then the tempature control circuit board is faulty. It has been by experience that if the tub is drained and the heater is left ""on"", the heater element burns out because the element doesn't have any water around it to keep it at normal tempature. Some tubes also have a sensor that detects when no water is present and shuts down the power to the element. This sensor circuit may also be faulty so if you replace the element it still may burn out. Have a qualified service tech thoughly check out the system, it's worth the money and a warranty on the work."

Turn to the left to slow the clock down and to the right to speed it up.This is trial and error. Make small changes and wait for several hours to see the change.

563,63845,"How do you remove ""cottage cheese"" from ceilings and what is the method to repaint it with that rooster print? ","Not used to removing ""cottage cheese"" but I often remove ""popcorn, knock down, orange peel"" from ceilingsFollow Instructions well (messy job)1. Remove all the furniture, artwork etc from the room2. Use roll plastic and masking tape to provide cover for  the floor, taping it securely to the baseboard around the room3. Get a broom handle and remove the broom head. Tape a drywall spatula to the end of the handle. Use several layers of tape to secure the spatula to the broom handle4. Bring a garden hose through the nearest window or door.Make sure the garden hose has a spray gun attached and place it on the fine setting (water should stream out not gush)5. Start in the far edge of the room and spray the ceiling till it turns color from white to a soft gray (May take some experimenting to see the amount of water you need to use) Test area should be approx. 6ft x 6ft. Wait approx 10-15 mins to let the water soak into the ceiling.6. Check the test area by holding up the broom and scraping with the spatula at a 45 degree angle (MAKE SURE YOU DO NOT DIG INTO CEILING ABOVE TEXTURE). Use a ladder if ceiling is beyond 8ftIf the test area was OK, the texture will fall off when you scrape it, if it is still too dry add more water and try again. Once you understand the technigue, spray the rest of the ceiling, wait 10-15 minutes and then scrape off the texture.After you are done scraping, please note that you may have to use joint compund to fill small holes or cover any exposed drywall tape (paper tape). Allow it to dry overnight and sand out the repaired areasp.s. When your finished, remove all the tools from the area and rollup the texture in the plastic and discardRooster Print ?Your really gonna paint Rooster(s) on your ceiling?Well here are general painting tips:1. Make sure there is plastic covering floor2. Use a good primer - I use KILLZ 2 which you can buy at Home Depot3. Use a brush to cut the edge of the ceiling with primer(NOTE: Apply masking/painter's tape to wall where it meets ceiling for best results) Make sure the entire edge has been painted around the room at least 2 inches wide4. Use a paint roller with an extension to fill in the entire body of the ceiling. Let dry at least 2 hours5. Check visually to see if the primer has covered the ceiling especially taking note of any stained areas. Repeat using roller until ceiling is uniform in color.6. Now that the canvas has been made, use the same paint techiques for a color paint (base coat) to go over the primer.I assume the rooster print is a stencil template which can be taped to ceiling after the primer and base coat are applied. Work slowly, making sure the template is firmly flat on the ceiling and choose brush and paint in relation to the size and color you needHope this helps ... CockADoodleDoo !!!"

588,5085,How can I fix my garbage disposal?  It makes the sound like it trying to work but doesn't? ,"FIRST READ THIS ANSWER.DO NOT GO DIGGIN IN YOUR UNIT FOR FOOD OR ANYTHING.Under most units there is a alan screwWhen you get the unit installed they will give you a alan set wrench to unclog the unit.all you have to do is make sure the power is off and put the wrench in the bottom (its next to the reset) and turn it back and forth this will losein what is in the unit. If you cant turn it and its stuck really good then you need to get all the water out of the sink use a shop vac- then look inside to see what it is. and go from thereThe reason i say dont just put your hand in because Im a plumber and I have seen many people get cut really bad because a spoon or something got in the unit and they put there hand in to grab it and got cut. You have to remember there are a set of blades in the unit also They are n ot sharp per say but over time they could get that way.Also a good thing to have on hand Is a Garbage disposal wrench ( it looks like the letter T with a moon shape pc on the bottom. What this does You insert it into the top of the unit and it fits between the blades and you move it back and forth. Just like the wrench under the unit but this 1 is alot more easy to use. And you could get this at and hardware store for 10 bucks.1 Last thing if the unit is bad due to a spoon and it got ruined Go buy a ISE Unit at home depot they ahve about 6 differnt ones there you want to buy 1/2 horse it will set you back bout 100bucks. But the good thing about these units are they have auto reverse. What this means is when you turn the unit on it works normal but when you shut it off it spins in reverse (this is done to reduce the risk of a jam in the unit) and also ISE is the best out there for home use. And I hate to say this but if you have a GD like a bone crusher or anything like that THEY ARE NOT WORTH 5 Bucks. They might seem to work but they do not chop the food into very small pc they are alot bigger, And this in time will cause the line to get cloged And you dont need that."

596,93158,how to replace ht leads? ,The HT leads are the high tension leads that link the spark plugs to the distributor and are very easy to replace. Firstly you need to check manufacturers specifications for ht leads because if wrong leads are put in it could cause all sorts of problems. Purchase the leads then simply change one at a time starting from cylinder 1 and making sure it goes to the correct connection on the distributor cap. One of the leads which we in the automotive trade refer to as the king lead looks slightly different to the rest and connects the centre of the distributor cap to the ignition coil. Failure to put the leads in the right place on the cap will result in the spark occuring in the wrong cylinder at the wrong time as leads are placed on the distributor cap in the firing order of the engine. This will certainly show itself as a loss of compression(engine power)

It is generally more expensive than brass and more corrosion resistant. Bronze forms a patina (green color) which is protective to the metal and is often seen on artwork. Reproduced it is called Verde. Bronze will deteriorate rapidly if exposed to moisture and chlorides or sulfides.Solid bronze often is lacquered (at the factory) to protect the finish. Lacquered bronze only needs dusting and an occasional wiping with a damp cloth. Have the lacquer replaced if it cracks or peels.Keep bronze pieces as clean as possible. Accumulations of dust and dirt can eat into the metal surface. Dust regularly using a soft cloth. Do not rub too vigorously, especially on any protruding parts. If a bronze piece has been neglected for a long time and is covered with grime, thoroughly clean it with a soft brush. Remove all dust from crevices and notches and then lightly rub the entire surface with a soft flannel cloth. For a more thorough cleaning, carefully wash with a solution of 1 tablespoon of salt and 3 1/2 quarts of water. Rinse well. Polish with copper polish followed by glass wax.  If you want a high polish, dip a cloth into liquid wax and apply to the piece. When dry, buff lightly to a high gloss. This wax treatment also may be given to bronze pieces that are kept outdoors. Weathered bronze usually darkens; however, this is natural and does not harm the piece.""Bronze disease"" is one of the most serious hazards of bronze. This disease, caused when chlorides and oxygen combine in a damp environment, also attacks brass and pewter. The disease takes the form of a sudden outbreak of small patches of corrosion and is distinguished by rough, light green spots. ""Bronze disease"" usually can be stopped by washing the piece in repeated changes of boiling hot, distilled water. You may have to soak the object for a week or more in distilled water. If this treatment does not work, consult a museum expert about using a strong solution of sodium sesqui-carbonate or have your piece treated by a professional.General Purpose Bronze Cleaner: Salt, Vinegar, and Flour. Dissolve 1 teaspoon salt in 1 cup white vinegar. Add enough flour to make a paste. Apply paste to bronze and let sit for 15 minutes to 1 hour. Rinse with clean, warm water, and polish dry."

As for the stone on the fireplace there is a product from saver systems that will take care of mild smoke residue, but it may need something more than that. If it does, you will need to vacate the residents for a day. Then you cover the area with heavy plastic sheeting, set up a fan system for fume elimination and break out the industrial strength masonry cleaner/acid available at your local hardware store.

You should really to a pressure test on an outside line first to determine if you have enough pressure coming from the meter. Look to see if there is a tee in the incoming water line before the water shutoff and regulator. If there is, that line is going to a hose bib ( spigot ) to the outside of the house. That will give you a real pressure reading from the meter. Pressure testers are available at Home Depot, etc. and just attach to the spigot like a hose. Turn on the water and get the reading. If you can change the water pressure be careful . If you have a spigot at some other location around the house, it will be the water pressure after the regulator.

This alone can take a while.Then you have to know how to read what it's saying.  Digital Theadolites (sp) automatically tell you the angle you turned once you line it up and set it to zero.

675,82145,how do you replace a brake rotor? ,"Loosen the lugs first. Jack up the car and place it on jackstands for safety.  Remove the lugnuts and the wheel.  Unbolt the caliper and brake hose retaining bolts.  Remove the caliper, do not allow it to hang from the brake hose (I use a bungee cord and hang it from the spring).  Remove the brake pads if they didn't come out with the caliper.  The brake rotor will now come off easily, if not lightly tap it with a rubber mallet.  Reassemble in reverse order, being sure to clinch the tabs on the brake pads if so equipped, and be sure the anti-rattle clips are in place on the back of the pads.  I use an anti-squeal product on the back of the new pads.  Be sure to torque the caliper bolts to the proper specification.  Once the wheel is on the ground, re-torque the lugnuts to the proper spec as well.  Take the rotor to an auto parts store for thickness measurement, if too thin replace with a new one as a thin one will break.  If thickness is ok, have the old rotor turned (surfaced) if severely scratched or gouged.  I change my pads about every 30K miles before the rotors get damaged.  Oh, you will have to push the caliper pistons back into the caliper with a 'C' clamp before re-installing the caliper on new pads."

But you didnt say ifd it was Electric or gas That plays a big part in it. And also what size it is 40/50/75 galIf its  Electric it could be a Element that is outIf its gas The thermostat could have went out on you. Not all the way but the easy way to say this is lets say the HWT thermostat thinks the water is 135DEG- But its only 90DEGThis would cause this problem.If you would like to E-Mail me withModel #- SER#What kind  IE- AO Smith/Bradford white (whatever kind it is)How many galElectric or gasIf you give me the numbers off the tank you wont need to give me the Gallons on it the numbers will tell me everything I need to know.The one thing I can tell you is that most people use there tanks year after year and bever maintain it. And thats Why I replace so many in a year.On the bottom side of the tank you will see a hose bib.It will be brass or plastic. What you need to do is hook a hose up to it and open the valve and let out about 10gal of water or untill its clear. This will flush out any dirt in the tank and give it more life.NOTE- Sometimes when you open a plastic valve they never want to shut off correct and they drip. If this happens to you open it and close it a few times this works sometimes if not then you will need to replace it. ( REPLACE WITH BRASS) You could use a cap on it but this is not the correct way to do this. 1 Other thing even though the tank goes from warm to very hot. You should never put it all the way up. There are a few reasons for this.1 You will burn the He** out of yourself or someone that uses it and does not know you have it that hot  like a child2 it tanks the life out of the tank. Anyways E-Mail me with that And I will tell you what to do if you have not solved this yetGoodLuck

By the sink area in each room, the wood has been discolored from water.  Is there a way I can get the original look back without replacing all the wood?",Typically the water will penetrate the varnish and erode the finish.  The resulting exposed wood will appear lighter.  If you dont want to replace the trim or remove it for refinishing you might want to try lightly sanding the areas where the wood is exposed and staining these area with a stain that you can most closely match to the trim.  Then coat the trim in this area with a marine type varnish following the instructions on the label.  You will find that brushing the varnish over the area will blend in the newly stained areas and while it wont look perfect it will look much better than it did.  You will want to test the varnish you are useing on a small out of the way area to make sure it is compatible with the existing finish.

In my opinion, having at least 4 mm tread is reasonable! You should also check the tire walls: slide your hand through the inside and outside walls of the tire. If you feel or see bumps extending from the plane of the wall, that's a thread failure, the tire is one step away from flattening !

733,119883,How do I turn off the check engine light of a 2000 Mazda Miata? ,"Unless you figure out a way to disable the light, the only way to get it to go away is to have the car hooked up to what is called an OBD II.  All mechanics shops have them.  It's a handheld device that reads the computer codes that caused the light to go on in the first place.  There are numerous sensors attached to the engine, and if any one of them gives readings that are outside the suggested parameters, the light will come on.  If it goes off, then the computer is no longer receiving a bad signal.  You most likely will have to have a sensor replaced before it will go away."

740,15291,How do I take appert cement blocks that have been cemented together? ,"You can use the chisel and hammer method, or even a rotary hammer to do it but if you do this you risk damaging the concrete blocks.  My advice would be to rent a Concrete Saw (the back end looks like a chainsaw and it will have a 10-14"" diamond blade on the front end).  Cut the grout line down the middle and try to avoid angling the blade.  To help you cut a straight line you can get a 4 1/2"" grinder and a diamond blade for it (the diamond blades can be expensive i'll warn you) and use it to score the grout) if worse comes to worse you can get a 7"" diamond blade and throw it on a skilsaw and use it set to a very, very shallow depth to cut your score line.This is a physically harder way of doing it but you'll have a much lower risk of busting blocks which if you used a rotary drill and chisel you almost certainly would.  I also doubt it takes much to cut through the grout."

It applies the paint really well and cleans up nice so you can reuse it. It is around 5.00 so it is affordable. Just push the brush on the roller with a little pressure cause the roller should be made so the brush wont slide right off while you are painting. You want the brush to go on so it is tight.

I have used several commercial products and have removed some of the finish but because the slate has ridges & divits the finish has settled in those areas and is not budging. My last attempt was muriatic acid in a small area which did nothing.  I desperately need help.,"I don't know what you've used, but what's on the floor is probably polyurethane, which yellows with age. Have you used a paint stripper? I would think that would work. As for the grout lines, use a brush made with brass bristles. They sell them at Home Depot in the paint dept. The bristles should be stiff enough to loosen the material from the grout lines without scratching the slate. Do a small area at a time, and remove the residue with a sponge and bucket of warm water. Keep changing out the water frequently so you aren't transferring residue back onto  the next section you clean."

If it's a wall same principle, take the length of the wall times the height times the thickness.If you're using an 80 pound bag of concrete mix (includes cement, sand, and coarse aggregates) then the yield is going to depend on how much water you add, but i'd say you're probably going to get about 2/3rds to 3/4's of a cubic foot out of each bag depending on the amount of water you add."
774,37260,how to fix moen mitchen faucet? ,"You'll need to obtain your faucets model#.  Most home stores(Home Depot, Lowe's, Menard's, etc.) will carry replacement valve parts for your faucet.  The best bet is to return the the place of purchase for the parts.  First start by turning the water supply off to your faucet.  Then remove the handle or handles.  If it's one handle there's usually a set screw on the back of the handle.  This will gain you access to the nuts that hold the valves in place.  Remove the valves and inspect, they may just need washers or o-rings.  If so it's an easy fix, if not just replace the whole valve cartridge if available.  If you can't find parts for your faucet then you may have to call a proffessional, he can order the parts you need.  Check out the link below, it has plenty of pictures and instructions.

779,73339,"How do I find and fix the source of a high-pitched squeal periodically sounding in my house? It sounds like the sound when you open or close a tap in an old house.  I live in an old house, but this seems to happen independent of any water being turned on or off, day or night.  I figure it might be my heating system, but can't seem to locate it in any one place.","What sjaquay5708 the maintenance tech said is right on. You've got to find the source, first. He named the most common -- toilet fill valve and hot water pressure relief valve. There are more possibilities, too.Put on your Sherlock Holmes cap and be alert to what's happening the next time you hear the squeal. It can come from the startup or idle down of a motor. What runs regularly? Furnace, refrigerator, freezer. Pay attention to what else is happening close in time to the squeal.Smoke alarms, when the battery is dying, will put out a random sound usually described as a ""chirp"" but that might come out as a short squeal.Doors can squeal when opened or closed or moved by the wind.At one time, way back when, TVs had tubes. When a tube was going bad there would often be a 60-cycle squeal. Only about one in three people could hear it. This would usually happen when the TV was turned on or off. Nowadays I would doubt anything like this, but hey, who knows?Some devices have a low battery warning even when turned off, and what about a forgotten alarm? Is there a lost cell phone in the couch cushions or a clock radio buried under clothing?Be imaginative. Use your hearing, your eyes, and your sense of what is going on to help isolate the cause.

With computer boards inside modern furnaces, a crossed wire can mean a $300 repair. Don't touch unless you're an electronics tech that can read a circuit diagram and figure out what would need to be done safely.A plug-in space heater would be your next best bet.

796,111504,how do you calculate the load each circuit breaker can handle(i.e.- lights/outlets per circuit)? ,"If you take the number of amps printed on your circuit breaker times the your voltage (probably 110v), that will equal the amout of watts your appliances can put out before they exceed the rating of the breaker.  Example:  15 amp breaker times 110v = 1650 watts  which means you could run 1 1500 watt toaster and 1 150 watt light bulb.  The amount of wattage your appliance consumes should be print on it.  So as long as you don't exceed the capacity with the appliances, that are running, you can plug in as many as you want.  Just don't run them all at once.  Hope this helps.  Good luck."

798,26720,How do I test electrical and electronic components on washers and dryers with a digital VOM? I want to learn this just to repair and resale out of my garage.Thank's for anybody's help and GOD bless you.,"There are lots of functions on a VOM, but you will use the AC and DC voltage, ohm, and continuity funtctions most often.  The voltage funtions will tell you if a part is getting power and what that voltage is.  The Ohm funtions tell you the reistance of sensors or other aparts and let you know if there in spec or need repalced.  The continuity funtion simple tells you if the wire or part between the probes is letting current pass through it.  REMEMBER NEVER TEST THE RESISTANCE OR CONTINUITY OF A LIVE CIRCUIT!!  You might just blow a fuse in the meter or blow the whole meter up in your hand!!  Many meters now have temp probes and can help you find problems with dryer air flow or heating elements.  There's not enough time or space here to tell you how to test all the parts or diagnose problems in appliances with your meter, but I would suggest investing in 2 books to help you out.  The first is a simple VOM how to book you can get at Radio Shack and the other would be one of the Time Life type of repair how to books that include appliances.  Both of these books will teach you most ways to use your VOM to diagnose problems and then repair what you find.  You've got a great idea to make some extra money and I wish you lots of luck!!"
799,23545,how to find a electrical short in car? ,"shorts usually occur wher a wire has to flex; sun visor lamp wire, door wires where they go from the door to the body, tilt wheel, under carpet.....cigarette lighters like to short out..short finders are available, they consist of a circut breaker to install in place of the fuse being blown, and a device that detects high amperage. move it along the wiring harness until it stops seeing amperage, thats where the short is.bobweb, that is an excelent method to find a parasitic draw, but not a short to ground. 1/4 amp would be a very excessive draw.. 25 milliamps is the max. or 1/4 of a tenth of an amp...you probably know this as you seem to know what you're talking about, maybe just a type-o...i bet neither of our answers are what the asker is looking for, usually when people say short, they mean open. am i right, asker? open circut means power doesnt make it all the way through the wire."

801,21735,How do I un-clog my tub? ,"Jack is right about trying the plunger first although I'd suggest using two plungers, one for the drain and one to go over the overflow (above the drain, below the faucet), if you don't block the overflow while plunging the drain, you'll just be giving the force of the plunge a way to escape and not affect the clog.If you end up using a snake, remove the overflow cap and rod it from there, not the drain. The pipe bends are not as sharp going in from the overflow, which makes it a lot easier.On a side note, it's not a bad idea to put some Drano down the tub drain once a month to help prevent build up and slow draining, especially in an older building. A drain strainer helps too. Catch the hair before it has a chance to clog."

First, make sure there is NO power going to the fixure. In the bottom of the socket is a tab that completes the circuit by contacting the bottom of the bulb. Use a pocket knife or something to scrape the contact point clean then bend it up a little as over time it can be squashed down to the point that it doesn't make contact anymore. Hopfully, that will do the trick."

811,48368,how to lay a tile floor? ,"The type of tile can make a difference in the way you tile. However, with all tile.  You need to make sure your surface is level.  If not there is a product you can get at Home Depot to fix it.  Once is dries, sand it down so that everything is level.  Then you're set to mortar you tiles in.  Follow that direction on the bag.  Rent a wet-saw to cut large tiles.  After you get your tiles set, you'll need to wait a least a day before grouting.  ONce again, follow the directions on the bag.  Make sure yo get all the tools yo need ahead of time so you don't wast time driving back and forth to the store.  Home Depot sells an all in one bucket that will have everything.  You might think about sealing it when you're done, at least the grout.  Just look through the sealers at the store and find the one that best meets your job.  Good Luck."

813,114285,how do you square up a room to lay atile floor? ,"I'd start at either the longest expanse of straight wall or the most visable (your choice), measure out the length of the tile + a 1/4 inch more than the width of the grout line, for example: 12''(tile width) + 1/4'' (grout line width) + 1/4'' (for slop, bow in the wall, etc.)=12 1/2''. Measure this out from your two corners and snap a chalk line. Find the center of the chalk line and use the 3,4,5 method of squaring the intersecting (90 degree) line. The advantage to starting with full tiles rather than starting in the middle is that you get less waste, spend less time measuring and cutting and don't end up working over tiles you've already laid. Also, unless the building is extremely old, the walls shouldn't be so out of square that it is noticable in the laid tile. If it is, use the center method stated above.The 3,4,5 method: measure 3' along the straight line from your center mark and mark it. measure down 4' from the straight line (center mark), then with second tape measure, hold the end on the 3' mark and run diagonally down to the 4' mark. When you get exactly 5' between the 3' and 4' marks, it's square. Mark it, then run a chalkline between the original center mark and the square mark and snap. You now have a perfectly square starting point.If someone can explain the 3,4,5 method more clearly, please do. I have a feeling my explanation might be a little confusing."

I just want to make sure he isn't scamming me.,"The broken bead will leak like others have said but should only cause a pull if it is low on air. Now another pull is alignment related. The last type of pull is from the physical make-up of the tire. The easiest way to eliminate if it is a tire pull is to have the car taken to a shop and have the front tires only rotated side to side. If the pull follows the tire from the right front you know that the problem is not an alignment issue but a tire issue. From here you have a few options, You could either have the tires rotated front to rear and the tire with the pull won't cause any more problems being on the rear, or you can replace that one tire."

Could also be a gas flow issue, meaning one or more of the gas exhaust vents has become clogged (e.g., with burned food) thereby limiting the total gas into the oven, which would limit the maximum temperature the oven could reach.To answer your main question, your oven works just like your home heating--a thermocouple/thermostat determines the temperature it is, and depending on the temperature you want, it lets gas flow or not (usually full on or full off).  The gas burns due to the pilot light."

Depending on the type of shop doing the work, and the type of engine the rebuild process could be simple or complex. Most shops disassemble the engine, hot tank the main components like the cylinder block, head(s), and related. Next, all clearances are checked to ensure that they are within factory specification. Cylinders may be bored, but most of the time they only require being honed and ridge reamed.If the crankshaft is out of spec. it will be reground. Meaning the rod and main journals will be ground down to make concentric again. The crank and rod main bearings will be replaced with the corisponding under sizes. The pistons will most likely be reused, and fitted with new rings.camshaft(s) and lifters are inspected and reused or replaced. Oil pumps are replaced. All freeze plugs and gaskets are replaced. Water pumps are replaced, as are timing gears and chains or belts.Cylinder heads are checked, and all valves are removed and checked. The out of spec vavles will be reground or replaced. Valve guides are checked, and replaced if worn. Valve stem seals are replaced.Things like intake and exhaust manifolds, oil pan, valve covers, timing covers, front covers, etc. are cleaned and reused.Most reman shops will paint the completed assembly.There are other engine specific things I didn't mention, but this is a general primer on what is done to an engine.Of course this is on the shop level, backyard mechanics, and wannabe diy'ers will do it differently."

The inner wheel bearing is trapped by the inner wheel bearing seal.  you'll destroy this seal getting it off but new ones are about a buck.  Clean all the grease put of the bearings, inspect them and re-pack them if you are reusing them.  The part the bearings ride on inside the hub is called the race and they are pressed in the hub.  Your new hub should have them in there already and you may want to buy new bearings just to be sure you're good.  I usually don't but you may want to.  Put the freshly packed inner bearing in the hub and tap on the new seal gently w/ a block of wood for a buffer.  Slide this into your spindle and place the outer bearing on.  Put the washer with the little nub orientated in the groove on the spindle and then put the hub nut on.  Tighten the nut and turn the wheel.  Keep tightening till you feel good resistance in the wheel turning effort.  Back off the nut a little and then repeat this step again.  when you have the wheel just to where it spins freely, hopefully your cotter key will line up with a hole.  Adjust slightly as neccessary.  Replace the dust cap, clen ALL grease from front and back of brake disc and reinstall the brakes."

862,119998,How do I remove oil stains from driveway? ,"1.   Pour cola on the oily or dry stained areas, and leave the cola on overnight. Squirt a generous amount of dishwashing liquid into a bucket until you have a good lather. Rinse with the soapy water, then with a garden hose.    2.   Sprinkle baking soda or an absorbent powder such as cornmeal or sawdust on the oily spots. If the stain is dry, wet it first to make a scouring paste. Scrub with a stiff brush or push broom.    3.   Sprinkle automatic dishwasher detergent on the oily concrete. Leave it for several minutes, then pour boiling water on the stained area. Scrub with a stiff brush or push broom, then rinse.    4.   Try a commercial concrete cleaner such as Garage and Driveway Cleaner by Red Devil Co. or a grease solvent such as Benzine. Follow the manufacturer's instructions.    5.   Sprinkle trisodium phosphate (TSP) on the oily concrete. If the stain is dry, wet it first. Let it stand for 30 minutes. Scrub using a stiff broom. TSP is a dangerous product; if you must use it, wear rubber or latex gloves, safety goggles and protective clothing. Also, never wash a TSP product down storm drains.    6.   As a last resort, combat tough spills with muriatic acid and a pressure washer. Apply the acid following the manufacturer's directions, and let it soak for several seconds. Follow with a pressure washer set at 2,500 to 3,000 lbs. per square inch (psi), or 176 to 211 kg per square cm. Like TSP, muriatic acid is a dangerous product; likewise, if you must use it, wear rubber or latex gloves, safety goggles and protective clothing, and never wash such a product down storm drains.    7.   After trying any of the strategies above, sprinkle baking soda over the cleaned area to neutralize the solution you've used."

880,7433,how do i know if the roto rooter im using is working? ,"Check for three things.  The first is if the 'rooter"" is removing gunk from the pipe. Pull it back occasionaly and check the tip and see if it has reached the clog.  If its fairly clean run the rooter farther down the pipe.  You may feel the rooter bit or grab into a larger or harder clog in a pipe.  If you do make sure you keep advanceing the rooter past the clog untill you feel the rooter loose the resistance as it exits the clog.  You may have to pull it back and advance it several times though the clogged area to completly remove all of the build up.  The last and most imporant thing to check is how well the water flows though the drain when your done.  If it still is slow or not flowing well, try again.  You might not have gotten all of the clog or there may be more build up down the pipe.  I like to snake the drain as far as the rooter will allow, even if I find a clog a short way down the pipe.  That way I know I've cleaned the pipe as well as I could and hopefully don't have to drag the rooter out again for a long time!!  After you get the pipe clear, try using a bacterial pipe cleaner every week or so.  It is harmless to you and the pipes ut will keep them very clean.  You can find the product at any hardware store or even WalMart.  It works well even on partially clogged drains and usually opens them up in 3 - 5 days. And you don't have to deal with the mess and hard work of using the rooter!! Good Luck"

The part number for the Door Jamb Switches from the Ford Dealer is SW-5528.  List is somewhere around $15 each I think, and it takes about 30 minutes per door to fix.  The trick is figuring out which door needs the switch - some sources recommend replacing them all, but if you open up the door and unplug the switch (it is actually in the door latch mechanism so you have to remove the inside door trim) the light will go out - try it on each door until you figure out which one is bad."

For connection of the compressor, the is no neutral, hence no 120 volts, rather the two wires, black and red, are 240 volts, with the green wire going to the green screw.Let me know how this works, and if you have questions, then don't be shy, there are no stupid questions when it comes to electricity.Alex"
919,94173,how can I unclog bathroom sink used mostly for kids brushing teeth. seems the toothpaste is a problem.? ,Well do NOT USE DRAINO Or L-Plumber These products will eat the pipes. BAD IDEAUse a plunger alot with very hot water. If this does not work then remove the trap under the sink and clean it out. Make sure it is a 1 1/2 trap and not a 1 1/4 trap if it is a 1 1/4 put in a 1 1/2 trap.Also if the kids are causein this with TP then change brands and tell the kids not to use so much and also put the stopper back in the sink this will stop big chunks from going down the drain.I would say if the problem is beyond the trap and in the wall then snake it out and use (roto-rooter drain cleaner) Call your local dealer for this. The product does work good but if the kids are useing that much TP there is not much your gonna be able to do.The only thing you could do is talk to them and make sure the stopper is in and there is 1 other thing.You could remove the pop-up-assm and put in 1 that has no stopper but it has a screen (like what you would see in a tub a bunch of small holes. This way things cant go down (but you cant stopp the water with the pull arm.)Goodluck.If you need anything else or info on how to change it out feel free to e-mail me atkos101@yahoo.com

923,95914,how to repair a broken water pipe? ,I have been in the plumbing field 20yrs and these answers I love these are the answers that make me alot of money.Quick run down.If it is copper you will need.Copper cutter/Sand cloth/flux/solder/torch/ A Pc of copper/2 Coulpings.1st cut of the bad section Then clean both ends with the sand cloth Also cut the PC of new copper to length if the pc you took out is 2foot cut a new pc 1/8inch shy of 2foot this will give just a little play you will need it.Clean the ends of the new pc and fold the sand cloth in a circle and clean the inside of the coulpings. (You could buy a ID cleaner but since this is a small repair save the 5 bucks.Put flux on all ends of the pipe and inside the fittings then slide 1 fitting on the old pipe slide the new pc into that coupling then slide the other coupling on the new pc of pipe pull the old pipe down a bit and let the 2 slide together. The 1/4 inch will let you do this.Then heat the pipe up and solder. Remember the solder will go towards the heat so heat up the bottom or sode then touch the other side with the solder and your done.Now if the pipe Is galvinized (THIS MIGHT BE A PROBLEM)You need to cut the pipe where the leak is then unscrew it from the fittings. The bad thing about this is alot of times it does not unscrew or it breaks. I Have went to replace a section of GL Pipe and I ended up removing 30 feet.If it is GAL- I would say Get someone out to the House that Has the correct tools. (Trust me)Now if it is Pex as 1 answer said well you cant fix it.although pex is pipeing for water the fittings that are used are special and the tool you would need to have cost about 400Bucks. So you just cant fix pex by going to home depot.Now there is Plastic pipe that looks like PEX But it is not the same thing. And that pipe is used in mobile homes and RV's for the most part.Now last if its PVC  You need Pipe.small saw/primer/glue/2 couplingsits almost the same as copper but you use the primer to clean and prepair the pipe then glue it.But most people have copper. So your answer is above. DO Not use bread or Glue or Tape.1 Other Thing and this is a MUST!!!!! Shut the water off before you do anywork on the pipes.You would not belive how many people forget about this small thing.Goodluck.And if you get stuck and you need help Feel free to e-mail me at kos101@yahoo.comPS- I was not and am not trying to be a jerk to anyone that put there answer to this question. But I have seen so many people do things because someone else has Personal EXp and all it does is make it worse. And evenm though its only a leak I have seen leaks cause alot of damage. I guess if you want to tell someone how to fix it dont say well there was this 1 time and i had duct tape and super glue and i got it to stop.
924,98443,how to replace the rear window on a 2003 ford ranger? ,"Before you replace Ranger rear window, consider replacing with a sliding rear window available at most auto part stores. It comes with instructions and is alot less $ than original glass, plus you get added ventilation."
925,3691,how to fix a lose fan belt? ,"Serpentine belts are typically flat, multi-ribbed and about 1 1/4 inch wide and have a tensioner that automatically keeps the belt tight. They literally ""snake"" around many power accessory pulleys.So you must be talking about a ""V belt"", named for the V shape that rides in the pulleys it drives. V belts are tightened individually by loosening the bolts which hold the driven accessory alternator, pump, compressor or other in place. Don't remove the bolts completely if you attempt to tighten the belt, and sometimes you need somebody to use a lever bar or similar to rotate the accessory and tighten the belt while you retighten the bolts. Some people try ""belt dressing"" to stop a slipping V belt (not for use on serpentine belts), but the best thing is to tighten or replace the belt if it is 6 years old or more. An auto repair manual (like Haynes) from the auto parts store can show details of which bolts to loosen, or you can go to a library and use their auto repair manuals."

The manual states that the headlight assembly must be tilted up and forward out of the front of the car before there will be any access to the rear side of the assembly to twist and remove the bulbs. The issue is removing the assembly in the first place -- the manual indicates that there is a snap in piece of plastic locking the entire assembly in place, but the actual car does not match the images in the manual, and there is a large piece of plastic which spans the entire width of the car. This piece of plastic appears to be secured with plastic nail-shaped plugs that don't seem to want to come out without being broken (probably single-usage snaps meant to be replaced). Do you know how to remove the assembly in the first place to access the rear side of it?","The piece of plastic that is the width of the car, is an air deflector and has to be removed to get at the 2 retainers that hold the headlamp in place. I use a pair of side wire cutters to remove the nail shaped plugs. If you do wreck the plugs, you can get them at any automotive parts store or your G.M. dealer which are pretty inexpensive. Should only be couple of dollars for all the plugs. Next you will notice two black retainers at the back of each headlamp assembly after the black air deflector is removed. Lift up or pull up on these 2 retainers to disengage the headlamp assembly and then pull the headlamp straight forward from the headlamp mounting panel. Remember to not touch the glass of the NEW bulb with your finger tips because the oil on your fingertips will cause the bulb to burn out prematurely. I hope this will help you."

First you must turn off the electricity to the disposer, so you don't grind up your fingers or hand! The take the cover off the top and see what is in there and how full it is.  You can reach (it's yucky!) down in there and pull things out as much as possible. Try to get something (a large wooden spoon works great!) to put in and try to turn the blades (both ways) until you get them loose. Keep reaching in as you get it free to take out whatever is stopping the blades from turning. Keep working with the blades and taking stuff out (I have had to work at it for over 30 minutes for the worst one!) until you can turn the blades. Then reconnect the power and try to see if it will turn by itself.To prevent this from happening again, put a small amount of ice down the drain every once in a while or grind up lemon or thin orange peels to help clean the blades out (The lemons and oranges will make it smell better too!) Set a restriction of things that cannot go into the disposer, and post it next to the sink on a cabinet door. The next one who clogs it has to pay for the plummer, or do this diry job themselves!

If you can remove the covers(zippers?), take out the inner cusion and discard the poly-batting(white cottony looking stuff). You can buy new batting by the yard or in packages at any fabric, craft, or upholstery shop. Re-wrap the old foam cushions in the new batting and put them back into the covers. If your foam is just too flat to save, you can purchase new foam at some fabric stores and upholstery shops also.If the ""backs"" are not removeable, and re-upholstering is out of the question, you could try to find a seam, open it buy carefully cutting the stitches, remove the old stuffing and re-stuff w/new material(batting).

959,93908,how do you change oil? ,"Start with gathering some information, from your owner manual or perhaps asking at the parts store.You need to know what grade and quantity of oil you need, such as 5 quarts of 5W30 motor oil.  For some cars, like VW's, Mercedes and BMW's, there may be some special oil specifications your new oil must meet, so make sure you are aware of those as well as the quantity.Also, make sure you learn if the capcity include the filter or not.  If not, find out how much oil you must add when you change the filter.  It's probably not more than 1 quart.Find out what filter you need.Finally, do you need a new crush washer for the drain plug.  Some cars have a crush washer that is supposed to be replaced during the oil change.You will need to gather:Tools, such as an oil filter wrench as well as a drain pan for the oil and a wrench or socket set for the oil.Oh, cheap kitty litter is good for soaking up any spilled oil if you should miss the drain pan.You will need rags to wipe your hands and a clean rag to check the oil.  You will probably also need a funnel and perhaps ramps or a jack and jackstands to raise the car.  Do not work on the car sitting on a jack only, use jackstands.Take a drive, getting the car warm and then return to where you are going to change the oil and raise the car.  Driving to the parts store to get any items you need and returning should be sufficient.Once you have the car up, locate the drain plug on the oil pan.  The oil pan should be at the bottom of the engine. If you cannot tell the engine from any other part, quit now, this is not a job for you.Being careful, since the oil could be close to 200F, place the oil pan beneath the drain plug, allowing some room for the oil to shoot out from the drain.  It may go as much as a foot or so from the opening, so plan accordingly.Carefully remove the drain plug from the pan.  It's a good idea to wear gloves, so you don't get burned by the hot oil.Hang on to the drain plug, or you'll be fishing it out of the drain pan.Remove the filler cap, it will help the crankcase drain.Go have a beverage, call a friend, surf the web a while, give your car 10-15 minutes to drain most of the oil.Now, return the drain plug when the oil is finished draining.  If you need a new crush washer, install it when you re-install the drain plug.Move your drain pan under the oil filter.  Look at the new filter to see what shape and size this item is.  Your old one may be a different color and will certainly be dirty, so don't count on color helping you here.I can often get them off with my bare hands, but if you need to, use the oil filter wrench to remove the old filter.  Drain the old filter into the pan.You may want to take some time and wipe up any spilled oil from your car.  When you remove the oil filter, you probably will spill oil on the car.  Just wipe it off.To install the new oil filter you need two things, new clean oil and your hands.  If your oil filter is vertical, with the opening at the top, it would be good to pre-fill the filter with some oil.  If your filter mounts sideways or the filter mounts with the opening facing down, don't worry, this is an optional nice touch.Put a small amount of clean oil on the gasket.  Make sure the old filter gasket is on the filter and not still on your engine.  Hand tighten the new filter.  Once the filter makes contact, tighten it 1/2 to 3/4 of an additional turn.  It should say how far.  Hand tighten, too tight and you won't get it off again, or it will crush the gasket and leak.Now, fill the engine with the oil change quantity of oil at the filler cap.  If this is the first time changing oil for this engine, I would not add the quantity specified for the filter until you can check the oil level.  Check the oil, if you can see new, clean oil on the dipstick, you probably have enough to start the car at this point.  Otherwis"

963,18296,how to install a generator on a 69 vw beetle baha? the battary keeps going dead and the red light in the speedometer is always on.  It seems like the battary is not charging when driven.  i beleive it is a 12 volt system.,"The generator has an external voltage regulator that must be checked for proper wiring and operation before condeming the generator.  The wiring to the generator must be checked as well.  The brushes on the generator can be replaced while the generator is still on the vehicle.  This is usually all that goes wrong with a generator.  Replacing the generator is somewhat complicated when the engine is still in the vehicle. I'll give it a shot but its been quite a while since I've done one.   The generator turns a blower that cools the engine located the big semicircular housing on top of the engine.  There is an oil cooler that sticks up inside this housing that has to be removed to get the housing off.  It is secured with 4 bolts if memory serves.  Remove the two 10 mm bolts on either side of the blower housing. You have to remove the generator pulley nut to take apart the pulley to remove the belt. Remember which shims went where.  Shims are used to tighten the belt. Remove the generator clamp and remove the generator stand or bracket.  After that stuff is out of the way you should be able to lift the blower housing to access the oil cooler bolts.  You will also have to remove the carburetor.  (Just 2 bolts, some hoses and a cable clamp).  When and if you get the housing out there is a large 36mm nut holding the blower fan to the generator that will have to be removed to transfer the fan to the new generator.  This job is a lot easier if the engine is removed from the vehicle.  Reverse the instructions above to reassemble.  I always wanted to say that!!  Other techs will understand."

985,111717,How to clean a brush that was used for staining? I was told to put the brush under water.  But it only became little gooey!  Must I wash the brush in running ( cold or hot ) water after use?  Should the brush be bone dry before using it again?,Ok First of all Most stain you need mineral Spirts to clean the brush out.Most of the stains and clear coat materials out on the market will say right on the front of the can WATER BASED.When it says this you clean it with warm water.Other then that you  need Min-Spi to clean the brush out.Next part of your question when you clean your brush out it does not need to be 100%dry but you need to get as much of the min-spi out you can do this by whipping it or placeing a dry rag down on a flat surface put the brush on it then fold the rag over and press down. Always remember when you clean a brush out no matter how good you do this 99% of the time after the brush dries out and when you go to use it again it will seem stiff all you need to do is brush your hand it will make the brush nice and soft again.PS- Always read the can before use. If you were to use Min-Spi on a water based stain the Brush can never be used again for water based again.A thing to remember just like with paint Latex paint you can always paint with latex or oil paint.But oil based paint you cant use latex on it.Once a brush or roller has been used for stain or oil thats all it could ever be used for again. But you could use a latex brush and go to oil but not back.And also the other answer that was givin if you were to use a brush and use it again 8 hours later you could rap it up but it would be better to put it in a can of Min-Spi this will make sure it dont dry up all all and all you need to do is whip it and dry it with the rag as good as you can.I have been in the field for 20 years and most people ruin brushes like this all the time. Read The can and Take your timeGoodluck

997,120798,How do I hook up a three way switch? I have electric to both switches but the light won't turn on.  I have changed the light bulb several times and that didn't help.  I have also changed the receptacle and that didn't help.,"Installing 3-way SwitchesFrom Apply Now,Your Guide to Home Repair.You can turn the lights on here and off over there, and you can do it yourself once you know the trick. It's not exactly simple, but it's far less complicated than most people assume. There are two important things to remember to make 3-way switches work right. One is that the switches are really single-pole, double-throw devices. That means that one of the three terminals on each switch is always connected to one of the other two. The terminal that is always connected is called the point terminal. It should be specially identified. Most commonly, the screw for the point terminal will be dark and the other two screws will be bright. Toggling - flipping - a 3-way switch changes which of the other two terminals the point terminal is connected to. To help visualize this, you can think of a 3-way switch as a ""V."" The bottom of the V is the point terminal and the top of the letter is where the other two terminals are. Each time the switch is flipped, the wire terminated on the point is disconnected from one of the other two terminal screws and connected to the other. The other important thing to remember is that 3-way switches come in pairs. It takes two of them, and only two, to make the system work. In addition, three-way switching works because the two non-point terminals on one of the 3-way switches are always connected directly to the two non-point terminals on the other 3-way switch with a pair of wires called the travelers. A three-conductor cable - with or without a ground wire - connects the two switches and carries the two travelers. The third insulated conductor in the three-conductor cable is used as a hot wire or as a neutral, depending on which is needed. In every 3-way switch system, the ungrounded conductor from the panel - the ""hot"" wire - is connected to the point terminal on one of the two switches. The switch-controlled ""hot"" wire, which connects the switch system to the first controlled light, is connected to the point terminal on the other switch. The grounded conductor - the neutral wire - is not switched. It is carried to the first light and connected there. There are three scenarios that cover more than 90% of all three-way switch installations. One of these should work for you in a new installation. If you're troubleshooting existing wiring, one of these will most likely be what you are looking at. Remember to turn the power OFF at the panel before starting. For a new installation, remember to use #12 AWG (American Wire Gauge) wire on a 20 amp circuit. You can use #14 AWG wire on a circuit protected at 15 amps."

1000,27165,how do u clean out the oil from a lawnmower??? ,"Depends on the mower, but there are two basic ways to do it.  Unplug the spark plug and check under the mower for a small plug going into the bottom of the engine.  That should be the oil drain plug & it normally has a square head.  If thats what you find, loosen the plug a bit, set the mower back down and lift it up on supports high enoght to put a drain pan underneath.  With the pan underneathe, take out the drain plug and the oil will flow into the pan.  After its stopped draining, replace the plug and tighten it snugly, but don't over tighten it.  Refill with new oil and your ready to go.On lawn tractors and some other mowers the plug is located in the engine block or at the end of a sort pipe above the mower deck or engine mount.  In his case, just get a pan in position to catch the oil remove the plug or pipe cap and follow the directions from above.Remember you want to do t=his with the oil warm, but not hot!!

1003,69552,how do you resilver a mirror? ,"Do you have an antique mirror that has silvering beyond redemption or has lost some of its silvering? You can have it resilvered, which is pretty expensive, or you can resilver it yourself, if you can find a kit, which is also pretty expensive and quite dangerous, or you can do it the quick and easy way. If there is just some silvering missing you won't need to remove the rest of it. If there are a few stains along with missing silvering, they add to the character of the piece. But, if you need to remove the old silver you can scrape the old silver off with a razor scraper (be sure it's a safe scraper and not just a razor blade) or remove it chemically. Be sure to dispose of the residue properly, because it will contain mercury and other dangerous elements. Also be sure to wear a dust mask if you scrape the old silver off. Next, you will need an inexpensive piece of 1/8"" mirror large enough to put against the back of the original mirror. If the mirror is square or rectanglular the job is done. If the original mirror is shaped, then lay the original mirror on top of the new mirror and trace around the original mirror. If the mark is larger than the original mirror, be sure to remove the original mirror and reduce the size of the marked area so it will fit inside the rabbet of the frame. Next, using a glass cutter remove the excess mirror. If you haven't cut glass before, ask for some scrap pieces where you buy the mirror to practice on. If you aren't too successful with your glass cutting, then have the glass shop cut the shape for you. They will charge a fee which will be considerably less than resilvering or replacing a shaped, beveled mirror.If you are just interested in the process:First the old backing paints must be removed with paint stripper.  Then you remove the old silver with a special silver stripper.  Next the glass is polished with a red rouge.  Then a flux solution is put on the mirror so the new silver will stick to the glass.  Finally you mix the silver chemicals and POUR the silver onto the glass.  The mirror is then dried.  Two backing paints are then put on the back of the mirror and let dry."

You can't reproduce this by applying anything to the surface. The best surface sealers are modified water born epoxy resins. They last about 5 years with proper application because they penetrate and bond to wood fibers better than oil based ones such as Thompson's. They resist mildew because they don't contain any organic oils, and are less effected by UV light. Most of your sealers won't last more than 2 years, and aren't much cheaper than the epoxies."
1007,113721,how do I install a door check on a securty door ???? ,"Do you mean a veiwing sight?  If so, most security doors are just made of sheet metal with a hollow core.  Just mark the location of the hole  (check veiwer package for proper size), use a center or prick punch to dimple the spot, start the hole with a small (1/8"") drill, then  select a metal cutting twist drill bit in the proper size, make very sure the  bit is stright level while finishing the hole.  From there it's just a matter of assembeling the veiwer following the instuctions that came with it.  The reason to use the 1/8"" bit to start is two fold.  First  it is the best insurance to prevent the larger drill from moving offcenter and marring your door and also if you find that there are any supports or fireproof matrial unnder the sheet metal, it's much cheaper to break a small $1 drill bit than a larger one.  Any fireproofing material can be drilled with a carbide tipped masonary bit."

1017,107295,how do i stop icicles & ice buildup on the edge of my house roof? ,"The reason ice dams form is because there is heat getting into your attic. This melts the snow on your roof which re-freezes when it gets down to the colder eaves. This can cause leaks as the ice can actually back up under the shingles. You need a good insulation blanket on the floor of your attic or, if insulating the rafters, make sure to install styrofoam baffles that will allow cold air to circulate between the roof sheathing and insulation. Ideally, you only want the snow to melt because it's warm outside, not because your attic is warm, this reduces the chance of a re-freeze at the eaves.A tell tale sign of poor attic insulation is when you look at a roof and can see the rafter lines because they're still covered in snow while the spaces between the rafters has melted."

Often the holes are hidden by a residue of old putty.The glass is placed into the sash on a bedding of glazing putty, springs are inserted to hold it in place, and then more putty is tooled onto the edges, covering the springs.

The center of the hole in the face of the door should backset between 2-1/4 to 2-3/4 inches from the edge of the door, depending upon the type of lockset.     2) Drill a Hole Through the DoorUsing a power drill with a hole-saw bit of the size recommended by the lock manufacturer, bore a hole into the door. Position the bit on the mark that was made with the awl and then, holding the drill steady, drill the hole through door just until it starts to break through to the other side. Then, to avoid splintering the wood, complete the drilling from the opposite side of the door. (Fig. 2)    3) Drill a Hole in the Door's EdgeNext, using a spade bit of the size recommended by the lock manufacturer, drill a hole into the edge of the door for the latch and latch plate. Drill through to the hole that was drilled in Step 2 on the face of the door.    4) Install the LocksetInsert the latch mechanism into the hole on the edge of the door and trace a line around the latch plate. Remove the latch mechanism and, using a sharp 1-1/4-inch wood chisel, make a mortise in the edge of the door so that the latch plate will be flush with the door. Insert the latch mechanism again, making sure the angled side of the latch is facing toward where the strike plate will sit in the door jamb  Before you screw it to the door, insert the lockset, making sure it is properly connected to the latch mechanism (if this is a keyed lockset, align the keyway downward, as shown). Then, tighten all screws.   5) Mark the Latch PositionClose the door and, using a sharp pencil, pinpoint the spot where the center of the latch hits the door jamb. (Fig. 5)   6) Position and Attach the Strike PlateHold the strike plate against the door jamb, aligning the center of the opening in the plate with the pencil mark made for the latch. Trace the outer edges and inner opening of the strike plate onto the door jamb. (Fig. 6) With a sharp wood chisel, cut a mortise into the jamb equal to the depth of the strike plate so that the plate will lie flush with the edge of the jamb. If the cut is too deep, use cardboard to raise the plate so it is flush. To make room for the latch, use a chisel or a spade drill to bore a hole at the center of the strike plate opening. Screw the strike plate to the jamb. Close the door and recheck the alignment of the latch and strike plate before tightening the screws."

1030,18904,How do i stop floorboards creaking - they're covered with carpet? ,"Squeaky floors are fairly common, and there aren't many homes that do not have at least one. Although they're aggravating, they do not necessarily indicate anything seriously wrong with the floor or its structure.Many things can cause a floor to squeak: warped boards that rock when stepped on; cheaply manufactured floor strips with ill-fitting tongues and grooves; a subfloor separated from the joists due to settling; or weakened joists that have dried out, rotted, or have faulty bridging. Because squeaks usually are caused by boards rubbing against each other, they can easily be silenced by lubricating or reattaching the boards.Locate the squeak by having someone walk over the noisy area of the floor while you listen and watch from below. Look for springy boards, movement between joists, and bridging that sags when weight is applied. As a precaution, inspect the area around the squeak for structural damage which may require the replacement of girders, posts, or bridging.The following six scenarios should help you troubleshoot and fix your squeaky floor.    1) Shimming the Subfloor Simple wood shims, wedged into gaps between a joist and loose subfloor boards, will stop all movement between the boards—and the squeaking it causes.a. Locate the squeak.b. Gently tap in shims to just fill the space between the joists and subfloor. Do not drive the shims too forcefully or they may further separate the boards from the joist and widen the gap you're trying to eliminate. A dab of adhesive on both sides of each shim will further anchor the boards.2) Cleating the SubfloorIf the squeak is caused by diagonally laid boards in the subfloor, you can eliminate movement of the boards with 1x4 or 1x6 cleats. a. Locate the squeaky boards.b. Place the cleat along the joist supporting the loose boards. Prop the cleat in place with a piece of 2x4 so it lies snugly against the joist and the subfloor.c. Using 8d nails, nail the cleat to the joist. Drive the nails while the cleat is firmly wedged into the right angle formed by the floor and the joist.d. Once the cleat is solidly attached, remove the 2x4 prop.   3) Bridging the Joists If you notice squeaking over a large area, the joists beneath the floor may be slightly shifting and inadequately supporting the subfloor. Stabilize the subfloor by attaching steel bridging between the joists, preventing them from moving side to side. a. Affix the first bridging. Hammer its straight-pronged end into the top of a joist. Drive its L-shaped, flanged end into the bottom of the opposite joist. The steel bridging should create tension between the opposing joists.b. Install companion bridging in a crisscross fashion.c. Repeat steps 1 and 2 for other joists, as needed. The result should be a series of firmly braced joists that are less likely to give beneath weight on the floor.  4) Installing Screws from Below When individual boards are loose or bulging, the resulting squeak can be fixed by tightening the boards with screws inserted from below. Use wood screws of a length that will penetrate the subfloor board but stop 1/4 inch below the surface of the finish floor. a. Drill a pilot hole into the subfloor the size of the screw shank. Put tape on the bit at 3/4 inch so you won't drill into the finish floor.b. Drill a pilot hole in the finish floor with a bit slightly smaller than that used for the subfloor. Tape the bit at 1-1/4 inches so you'll stop within 1/4 inch of the finished surface.c. Insert the screw through a large-diameter washer, and turn it into the hole. As you tighten the screw, it will bite into the finish floorboards and pull them down.  5) Nailing Through the Finish Floor. If you cannot gain access to the subfloor, straight nails can be driven through the finish floor to anchor loose boards. a. On hardwood floors, drill a pilot hole narrower than the nail to reduce the chance of spli"

Use a brush or roller and apply just like you would paint. If you are re-staining, ideally you'd want to take a pressure washer to it but if you don't have one, give it a good scrub with a stiff bristle or wire brush. Make sure to THOROUGHLY stir the stain, and stir it every 10-15 minutes otherwise some of the stain will be like water and the bottom will be thicker than paint."

1037,34001,"how do you remove baked on grease from a cast iron skillet, and  what is the best way to maintain? ","Here's How:1.   Wear rubber gloves and eye protection while cleaning cast iron since the methods require using caustic chemicals.2.   Begin by spraying the pan with oven cleaner and putting it in a plastic bag.3.   After a day or two, take it out of the bag and scrub it down with a brass brush.4.   If all the grease doesn't loosen up right away, repeat the process concentrating cleaner on stubborn spots.5.   If you have several dirty items, soak them in a solution of one and a half gallons of water to one can of lye mixed in a plastic container.6.   Allow them to soak for about five days, then remove the pieces and use the same brass brush method to scrub them clean.7.   Removing mild rust should be done with a fine wire wheel on an electric drill.8.   Crusted rust can be dissolved by soaking the piece in a 50 percent solution of white vinegar and water for a few hours.9.   Once the pan's clean, begin the seasoning process by warming it in the oven for a few minutes then applying a little shortenting, vegetable cooking spray, lard or bacon fat.10.   Put the skillet back into a 225 degree oven for 30 minutes. Remove and wipe it almost dry to eliminate any pooled grease.11.   Place the pan in the oven for another half hour or so, completing the initial seasoning.12.   The seasoning process will continue with use, especially if you use it to cook fatty foods (bacon, sausage, fried foods, etc.) the first few times it hits the stove.13.   To clean after cooking, boil hot water in the pan. Let it soak for several minutes and then wipe dry with a paper towel.14.   Reheat the pan and apply just enough grease to wet the surface before storing.Tips:Use the methods above only for cleaning iron.Don't soak pans in a vinegar solution more than overnight without checking them because the solution will eventually eat the iron.After cooking, do not use detergent or scouring pads to clean a cast iron pan since this will destroy the seasoning.What You Need:Rubber glovesEye protectionSpray oven cleanerLarge plastic zip bagBrass brush"

It didn't start. How do I put it back in time.,"Tina tinkerbell does timing??? I am afraid to answer this one because if you have cranked the motor without the timing belt you have probably damaged the valves, if as I suspect you were smart enough to replace the timing belt before cranking the motor then the belt could have slipped a notch and just be in the wrong position. This is not entirely good news cause you could have still damaged the valves. I will proceede with the assumption that the valves are undamaged and hope for the best. First you need to get the no.1 cylinder in the tdc position That's top dead center if you don't know already. Then you will find a notch on the the pulley that drives either the camshaft or the valves depending on how many valves you have. If it is two valves per cylinder you will have a camshaft, if it is three or more then you most likely have a pulley for each camshaft (more difficult). anyway there has got to be something to line up this notch with. I would suggest that you go to your local auto parts store to get the manual for this vehicle and it will tell you exactly where this mark is, otherwise the notch will be straight up. And then you just slip the belt back on when the mark is straight up and presto chango the car should start.as long as nothing else is broken.Aloha!!!origionalsurfdude@yahoo.com"

I rather just buy the resistor or what ever and make my own. If you know anything about it, please let me know. Thank you.",Depends on what car you are talking about. Every computer controlled car has a different voltage input for the oxygen sensor. The sensor sends a voltage signal and tells the computer if the engine timing needs to be adjusted or not. The eliminator sets this to one constant voltage that tells the computer to advance the timing and leave it there. Thus giving your car better performance and acceleration. But you will need to find what that voltage is at WOT for your car. If you have a car with OBDII system (most 1996 to present cars) then you may can get a programmer to bypass these signals and manually set it to what you want.

Cut a piece of line about 20 feet long, thread one end through the hole and pull it even so that you have two equal lengths. The wind both pieces at one time around the spool. There should be an arrow on the spool telling you which way to wind. Wind the string snugly but not tight.

1092,42786,"how to remove old shower knobs? I have an old house built in the 40's and the hot knob just spins and spins and won't completely turn off the water any more. I need to remove it, but after taking the screw out of the center it seems stuck on and I have tried prying, but it won't come off.  suggestions?","You are dealing with a compression faucet. The valve opens and closes via a valve stem. That stem has splines on the end of it, underneath the handle. The handle has ridges in the backside hole that mate with the splines. If the handle is spinning around on the valve stem, what has happened is that the splines and or ridges have worn and do not mate properly. Since the usual reason that you cannot remove a handle after removing the screw beneath the index cap is corrosion between the mating surfaces of splines and ridges, I doubt this is your problem since the knob is spinning around the valve stem. Look on the side of the handle for some sort of set screw. These are fairly small and usually require an allen wrench to remove them. If there is none, try prying the knob off with a large flathead screwdriver under the handle. Place something such as a paint stir stick between screwdriver and any surface that may become damaged. If that doesn't work you could purchase a faucet handle puller for the job.Once you have the handle removed most likely you'll need to replace the valve stem. You will need to turn off the water to the valve. If the shower does not have shut offs somewhere nearby ( most likely it won't) and you are wanting to remove the hot water valve stem, you should be able to shut off the cold water supply to the hot water heater to avoid having to use the shut off for the entire house. By turning off the cold water supply located on the line coming into the hot water heater, you are in effect shutting off pressure to all hot water faucets in the house. Then untighten the packing nut that holds the valve stem in place. You should now be able to continue backing out the valve stem until it comes out of the seat. Take this to a hardware store and replace. Why did all this happen in the first place? The screw under the index cap became loose and allowed the handle to start grinding the splines off. Hope the info helps."
1093,25997,how do I remove human blood stains from cloth? ,"First thing, DO NOT WASH IT IN HOT WATER! That will set the stain in.

You must keep it water tight or your car may not run any more. Also make sure to cover up the carb or throttle body if you have one. Watch how you spray around the alternator, it could also get damaged. I would recommend using a low pressure water hose. After all of that I would start with something like a spray one Mean Green degreaser or a good foaming degreaser. Then rise and use a good metal polish on valve covers and anything else metal, then use an armor all protectant for hoses and any plastic trim you may have. By this time your engine sound look like new. You can also add some detailing features like spray painting any thing that may look old and dull. Painting your block is also a nice touch. If your exhaust manifold are looking rusty. They make a high temp stainless looking paint that will brighten that up as well. I hope that this info helps."

1101,76231,"How do you sew a button back on a pair of trousers? The button had been ripped off, leaving a small hole where it had previosly been.  Is it possible to reattach said button in this manner?","Buy your sweetie a nice dinner out, then humbly ask afterwards.   OK.  Thread your needle and knot thread at the end.  Approach garment from inside with needle.  Put needle through fabric where you want the button to lie and pull the thread through to follow.  Put the button through the needle and let it fall to the waistline.  Take needle and put it downward through another hole.  Repeat this a 3 times or so, then take a pin and put it under the thread holding the button on on the outside of the garment.  Then continue to stitch the button on until you've gone through the button 12-14 times or so.  Stop stitching when the needle is in the inside of the garment.  Push needle through the garment as close to the center of the button but UNDERNEATH the button and pull thread through.  Wind the thread around the underside of the button 3 or 4 times, then push needle and thread through to inside of garment.  Take a little bit of fabric near the button stitches and push needle/thread through until you've got a little loop left.  Take the needle and put through the loop and pull thread taut.  This will ""lock"" the stitch.  Repeat a couple times, then cut thread.  Remove the pin from the button on the topside of the garment.  (By using the pin in this way, you put a little ""give"" between the button and the fabric which will make the button lie correctly.   Regarding the hole in the fabric, you can ""darn"" the hole first by stitching back and forth across it to make a thread base, then use the thread base to stitch your button to."

1107,85616,How do I remove textured paint from my ceiling? ,"If you mean 'popcorn' texture you will need to know what type of texture was used on the ceiling. Although I don't believe anybody uses Asbestos in residential buildings anymore it is still legal to do so and was used through the 1980's in a lot of construction. The laws against Asbestos only forbid it from being developed into new types of products. There are currently dozens of things that Asbestos can be used in legally. If you cannot be sure that your texture is not made from Asbestos you should have a professional contractor remove your texture for you.That said, if you have a steamer spraying the ceiling a little to soften the texture then scraping gently with a spatula (6"" is a good size) to remove the popcorn. You could also use a damp sponge with warm water before scraping. Just be careful not to gouge the ceiling with the corner of the spatula."

Any suggestions?","Hard to say without seeing the installation.  Check if sink faucet flow is strong (if not main valve to house or apartment may be partially closed and should be wide open - should check it open anyway).  To check that a valve is open you should be able to turn it a couple turns shut then open it all the way.   If flow is weak do you use a well pump or city water?  If system has low pressure you may not be able to block flow from a sink faucet with thumb pressure (I can stop water flow at my camp using my thumb but not at my house on city water which is probably about 80 psi.  If you have a city water pressure problem, neighbors should have the same problem.  Next, see if there are valves available that isolate only the tub for repairs (if there are any these should be wide open).  Next, is flow weak for both hot and cold water?  Each line would have its own isolation valve if provided.  If flow is weak for both hot and cold water, and there is a diverter valve in the tub faucet for a shower head, the diverter may be jammed due to mineral buildup or corrosion and may be blocking flow.  That may require a plumber or a handyman.  Do the hot and cold valves oof the tub faucet require the same number of turns to full open?  They should be about the same or one may be installed wrong.  Good luck."

Invest in a screw remover tool, like an Easy Out- drill a small hole into the screw and drive a reverse threaded bit into it. As you keep tightening the reverse tool, it will turn the screw out.4.) Try a product like Screw Grab- a gritty material that makes screwdrivers or other tools fit the slot or hole in the head of the screw better.5.)

The tunnels also protect them from bright sunlight which they hate worse than a vampire does. So the first thing you do is simply go around the outside perimeter of your concrete foundation and scratch off any of their mud tunnels you find on the surface or in cracks at corners etc with a screwdriver or putty knife blade. They like dark crawl spaces under porches or room additions where they can get to the moist earth and build their mud tunnels straight up to the wooden floor joists. Of course any wood in direct contact with the ground is a highway to your house for them.Termites can survive in a house without having the mud tunnels going back to the ground if there's a source of water from a leaking roof or pipe etc. The worker termites are small white larvae looking things, and in the spring you'll typically see them swarming (flying) which says that they're around alright."

1193,11459,how do I change the serpentine belt on my 01 dodge intrepid? ,"When inspecting the belt, if it appears to be glazed (shiny), show cuts, cracks or other deterioration on either side or on the edges, has chunks missing from it, or is merely noisy—it has to be changed. It's helpful if you can determine the cause of a particular problem—from normal wear to damage—so you can be assured that the replacement belt will last the full duration of its service life.   Before taking off the belt, check your service manual for any helpful tips that apply to your specific vehicle. One caution: as belt tensioners are sprung very tightly (some tighter than others), any ""slips"" involving the wrench used to loosen belt tension can cause serious personal injury, as well as damage to the surrounding area under the hood. Ideally you should use the special service tool designed for belt-tension removal (via the tensioner). Be aware of where the tool will be positioned when tension is removed and make sure the tensioner is resting on its internal ""stop."" Obviously, if the tool contacts another component before the tensioner stop is contacted, tension is not completely released and the tool will ""jam"" if left to rest in that position. The possibility of the tool slipping off of the tensioner is high, and injury will likely result. Once tension is properly released, it's time to remove the belt. Start removal from the most easily accessed and largest pulley having the least amount of belt contact, if possible (sometimes this is the tensioner, sometimes not). Usually, it's just a matter of pulling the belt clear of the other pulleys and right out of the engine bay. However, sometimes engine mounts or other components such as splash shields first need to be removed. Once the belt is out, here are a few other components to inspect: > Coolant pump for leakage (will cause belt noise if coolant gets on belt) or bad bearing > Fan Clutch (if equipped) for fluid leakage > Fan for damage (especially a problem with plastic fans) > Tensioner unit for noisy pulley bearing or wear on tensioner mechanism > Idler pulley(s) for noisy bearing or irregularly worn belt contact area (especially a problem on plastic pulleys) > Any under hood component that is making contact with or is close to the belt, tensioner, or any pulleys > Any other source of fluid leakage onto the belt With all of that correct, the belt can now be installed. Since all replacement belts are not created equal, get the best quality belt possible. The same cautions highlighted earlier should be observed on reinstallation. Be patient. Route the belt in reverse order of removal, keeping especially vigilant about making sure that the belt ribs are set correctly in the pulley grooves, and the back of the belt is squarely contacting the tensioner and idler pulley(s), before starting the engine. If applicable, note the tensioner position ""scale"" (its arrow should be somewhere between the two lines on the other half of the tensioner, preferably on the ""tight"" side). If it's way off, the belt may be incorrect. phew...hope that helps."

1199,115358,how do i bleed the clutch on a toyota truck? ,"To bleed the clutch system on a toyo pickup is pretty easy. First thing you should do is suck all the old fluid out of the clutch master cylinder with a suction bulb. That way it doesnt have to leak slowly through the lines. Then fill the clutch master cylinder up completely with DOT 3 brake fluid. That is what Toyota uses. Go underneath the truck on the right hand side, look at where the engine joins to the tranny. The bellhousing as it is called, has a clutch slave cylinder mounted on it. It is a round cylinder with a rod coming out one end, and what appears to be a brake line attaching to the other end. Look closely on the end with the line, and you will find the bleeder screw. It is a 10mm. Use a 6 point wrench if you have it, if not, a good quality 12 point. You dont want to round the flats on the bleeder. It works like a brake caliper bleeder. Just loosen it a couple of rounds, and let the fluid start to drain out. If there is air in the system, it may take a minute to sart draining. Use a bucket to catch the fluid, and let it drain until the fluid coming out is clear and not bubbly. Make sure you keep an eye on the master cylinder up top as it is pretty small and will run out of fluid quickly. When the fluid is clear and not bubbly, retighten the bleeder screw, fill the master cylinder reservoir, and you are almost done. Some air tends to remain in the system inside the master cylinder, but if it does, you can remedy it easily. Just get in the vehicle, and start pumping the clutch. ALL the way to the floor, and ALL the way back up. It may take a while to work the air out, so if you have bad knees, find someone who needs to use a stairstepper. When the pedal feels nice and crisp, and your clutch starts disengaging around the middle of the pedal travel, check the fluid again, and you are done. Pretty easy."

1207,117090,How would I find a fuel leak in my car? ,"Usually you smell gas first, if only faintly as apparently you have. Some of the gas line connections or the line itself eventually rust through and the gas just wets the outside of the line right around where the rust spots are. So follow the lines as suggested above, and look for wet spots. The fuel vapor recovery system in your car might also be responsible for a gas smell if it's not working properly. Fuel tanks rust through eventually and start leaching gas also. Gas leaks are dangerous as you know, so get it fixed ASAP."

1209,127780,"How to make the hot water last longer? My house is not too too old, but not new. When I move it, i was nine, the owner son just graduate from university. The owner build the house. So that's about how old is the house.Everytime I take a shower, it's like a race, I have to do it as fast as possible before the hot water runs out. A handy man had come over, and he said and switch the temperature of the hot water hotter (he did it at the hot water production machine located at the laundry room), that's all he can do. But switching the hot water temperature hotter doesn't help make hot water last longer.I thought it was just me taking shower too long, but I ask my friend, and she said she took very long and hot water still did not run out.How to make hot water don't run out so quickly? Especially in winter, it runs out more quickly.",I assume you have an electric water heater. If so I suspect one of the elements is burned out or one of the thermostats is bad. Electric water heaters have two thermostats and two heating elements. If one of the elements burns out or one of the thermostats quits working you don't get enough hot water.But first connect a hose to the outlet at the bottom of the tank and run water out of it for 10 minutes. See if clearing the sediment helps. Sometimes sediment keeps the bottom element from working right. If it doesn't help then it is either a thermostat or heating element in which case you should call a service man and have it repaired.

1211,40985,How do I paint wood paneling? I know it sounds tacky but it's my only option at this point. I'm wondering how to prepare it so the paint will stick.,I have always used Bullseye primer/sealer to paint paneling - especially dark paneling because it will cover in one coat. There are no issues with coloring the sealer if it is a earthtone color because anything darker may exceed the recommended maximum amount of coloring you are allowed to add. You can also use Kills sealer but you will need at least 2 coats. The other advantage to using sealer is you do not need to prepare the paneling so it will stick unless the paneling is covered with grease or oil. In that case I would use a degreaser that has orange oil in it.

Be sure this is your problem first, it not hard to do, just sounds hard. You can have someone turn on the key and open the Fill Cap and listen for the pump to run, if it runs and then shuts off it may be good. Check your Fuses and sometimes there a safety shut off that may have got accidentally trip and needs rest, it to keep fuel from pumping if you in a wreck. If, the fuses, Fuel shut-off safety are good and you not see a damaged wire then you ready to drop your tank and replace the fuel pump. Good Luck and be careful. Maybe a friend can help."

IF, it is not the P-trap clogged and further down the drain, you may have to use a small Rotor-Rooter it a flexible spring thing. Hardware stores sell them. They worth the money, because you may need it again, and, what it save in Plumber costs it Money well spent. Another thing you can try, but, you have to think. When the P-trap removed and the clog is further down, you can try a Garden Hose, poke the end in the Drain and SEAL around it with something and have someone turn on the water, sometimes the water pressure will force the clog to move to the next bigger drain. The water from the sink and dishwasher not have pressure to force the clog to move."

I am called the Princess of Plumbing in my town and my suggestion to callers when they call in with this situation is to get a pail of water and pour it down each floor drain.

Try these steps:1) Take the rear tire off2) Take the brake calipers off, but leave the brake line fastened. Use a small piece of rope to fasten the caliper away from the work area. 3) Take the brake rotor offYou should see the workings of the parking brake by this time. It is basically like any drum brake system but smaller. Usually, there is no wear on the brake shoes because they are rarely used except for parking. Make sure there is no unusual wear on the shoes. If there is, then replace the brake shoes.If there is a problem with the parking brake, it is usually when the brake is set because the tensioner has loosened ands the shoes aren't closing on the drums. The parking brake uses a cable system that runs through a tensioner that should be located under the car along the drive axel and just ahead of rear transaxel case. The brake shoes should be completly closed when the parking brake is set and completely free when it is released. Adjust accordingly if this is not the case. Also, it is a good idea to obtain a repair manual to verify the process of fixing your Corvette rather than relying on quick answers found here. If it was a Mustang that you were working on.. Well, that's a different story.Good luck!"

These calipers are notorious for seizing and having e-brake problems, in turn causing accelerated wear. My honest opinion, if you must ask how to do it, you probably shouldn't be doing the brakes on your car. The 2 most important things on a car are tires and brakes.

1289,93296,How do I change the oxygen sensor in a Dodge Dakota? ,"1. Get the oxygen sensor you need from the parts counter of a Dodge/Chrysler dealership. Emissions problems can be really tough to track down, so for this you want to spend the extra money to get the real thing. Know engine size, transmission type, year, CA emissions or not, high altitude or not, etc. before you go to the dealership, since all these things might cause a different version of the sensor.2. Replace air filter and PCV valve before you put in the O2 sensor. PCV valve should be changed with every oil change. Fresh oil and filter are always a good thing. (Reason? Oil blowby contaminates O2 sensors.) I also replace fuel filter (never gets done) and check fuel pressure, since if these things are poor, the computer may misinterpret them as an O2 sensor. 3. Disconnect the battery. Not strictly necessary, but always good practice, especially since wrenches have a magical way of falling between the starter motor's positive lead and ground. It may also clear the ECM's RAM. 4. With exhaust system warm but not hot, use a combination or deep socket wrench to get off the old O2 sensor. I usually cut the leads off the old one first. Remember you cannot splice an O2 sensor's leads. Use a 6 point socket for better torque, the sensors have a habit of being corroded into place. 5. Apply the anti-seize compound which came with the new sensor. Thread it in by hand and then torque it to specification using an O2 sensor socket and a torque wrench. 6. Plug the new O2 sensor into the harness and reattach the wires to supporting clips. 7. Reattach battery and start up the truck. The truck may behave oddly for a few minutes as the computer re-learns that the feedback system is now working properly and re-enters optimal closed loop mode. (ie. Check Engine light goes out and computer stops throwing diagnostic errors.)8. Re-read fault codes in a week. There should be no new codes. Single-wire (non-heated) O2 sensors are usually cheap enough to get into the habit of changing them every 50,000mi or so - basically every set of tires. O2 sensors get slow in time as deposits cover them. Keep the engine in tune to keep deposits to a minimum. Tune-ups (plugs, leads, cap, rotor, etc.) and fresh O2 sensors will save you gas money."

1308,95646,how do you locate a hole in an above ground pool liner? ,"First check the pad to make sure that there are no visilbe leaks.If no visible leaks then fill the pool up to the maximum level. Then do what's called a static water check. Turn all the equipment off and wait a few days until the water seeks the level of the leak, in which case it will stop lowering. Then take a very close look around the perimeter of the pool water and look for the leak. If it is in the liner, then patch it. If it stops at a suction or return line take a close look for any crack or break, if so then use something like an A and B expoxy to repair it. You can get it at your friendly neighborhood pool store. If you think the leak could be in the pool plumbing (between the pool and the equipment) you need to purchase some expandable test plugs (you can get them at Home Depot and other fine hardware stores) and plug all the suction and return lines (including the main drain if you have one). Big bummer if you have to swim to the bottom in cold water. You may have to use a screwdriver to remove a plastic cover to expose the piping to get to certain areas. Make sure you measure the pipe before going to the store to purchase the plugs. Most piping is 1 12"" pvc or 2"" pvc. Once the plugs are installed, fill the pool again and wait a couple days. If the level stays the same, the leak is not in the pool liner, it is somewhere in the plumbing.  If the piping is underground then big bummer dude. If that's the case I would next talk to your freindly neighborhood pool repair person for the next step, which could be pressure testing, etc. It all depends on how easy or difficult it is to access your plumbing. Good luck."

1336,135530,"how to remove the odor from fire and smoke damage in our home? our son has respitorary problems, and We want to make sure that our contractor is doing all that he can to remove as much odor as possible","First make sure your contractor remove the burned or charred items.  This might seem obvious but on many occasions this crucial part is overlooked.  Secondly using water to clean everything might cause more harm than good. Adding water to burned or smoke affected items often times will ""lock-in"" the burned smell.  To insure that the smoke smell is lessened in severity ask the contractor to use ozonator in the home's environment.  An ozonator emits an oxygen-3 molecule which attaches itself to the carbon molecules that cause that ""smokey"" smell and renders it neutral.  There are to be no occupants in the home during the ozone's use and the house should not be occupied for 15-30 minutes after the ozone generator is cut off.  To insure that your Contractor is diligently addressing the smoke smell you may want to consult one of the many IICRC (Institute of Inspection, Cleaning and Restoration)certified contractors/consultants in your area.  You can reach the IICRC via the Internet at iicrc.org"

1338,56495,how to  get rid  moss in lawns? ,"Moss in yards has been a common complaint this spring. It occurs in sun or shade, alkaline or acidic soils and in wet or dry sites. Moss is very adaptable and can grow in difficult conditions. In poor sites, the moss moves in as the grass dies out.The easiest way to eliminate moss is to rake it out of the affected areas and alter the conditions responsible for its presence. If moss is occurring in a shaded area, consider planting the area with shade tolerant grasses such as creeping red fescue, chewings fescue or hard fescue. If the fine-leafed fescues have failed, perhaps it is time to consider alternative shade tolerant groundcovers rather than grass. Surrounding trees may need to have their lower limbs removed or the crown of the tree thinned to allow more light penetration. Remove unnecessary shrubby undergrowth as well.When moss occurs in a sunny location, consider fertilization practices. Even low-maintenance lawns need one or two fertilizer applications a year to grow well. In some cases the soil may be compacted and need aeration as well. Soil testing will provide the soil pH. Grass grows optimally at a pH of 6.8 to 7.2 which is close to neutral. Many people automatically assume the soil is acidic when moss occurs and want to add lime. Iowa generally has alkaline soils and liming can make matters worse. A soil test will eliminate the guesswork.Materials, such as copper sulfate, do eliminate moss in lawns. Use these products according to the label directions. However, copper sulfate only cures the symptom, the moss. They do not change the conditions responsible for its presence. When moss occurs in the flower bed or vegetable garden, simply rake off the moss and till the area. Once normal (sunny and drier) weather makes another appearance, moss growth should slow and disappear."

1385,103314,how do you pull the air bags out of a suzuki grand vitara? driver side and passenger side are blown need to pull and reinstall new bags,"One word of advice, when it comes to airbag repair, if you don't know what you are doing, DON'T! If you still wish to dive further, consult a factory manual! Also, other parts need to be replaced such as the sensor that caused it to go off. If you replace the airbags and not the other parts, you risk the new bags going off. Not pretty! Again, make sure you replace everything you need to, some cars you even need to replace the airbag module as well. Please be careful!"

1391,84562,how do you change a serpentine belt on a 1995 chevy cavalier w/air? I have replaced the alternator and I have the belt in place but can seem to get the pullies loose enough to put the belt back on.,"There should be a a ""spring loaded"" tension pulley on it somewhere. Follow the path of the belt until you find it. Once you locate it you should be able to put a socket or wrench on the pulley and pull it (not turn it) as you do you should see the tension on the belt release. Once it is loose enough slip the old belt off. The precess i the same to put it on except you need to have the new belt correctly around all the other pulleys and when you pull on the tension pulley it helps to have someone slip the belt on for you.Note: It will take a lot more pull to get the new belt on then it did to get the old one off. The old bet has stretched so you don't have to pull as far.Hope that helps..."

The rest of the house has grounded 3 prong outlets. What is the best method to replace the outlets and effectivly ground them without a whole house reqire.,"Lets not run to re-wire so fast.  A grounded system is a great idea.  Especially for safety, not to mention computer grounding, stereo equipment, etc. that is susceptible to static and free electrical problems.You need to find out if the wiring was ran through shielded conduit to a metal junction box where your plug is located.  If so many times the conduit can be grounded.As is always the case, and as mentioned above, you and your family's safety is the first concern.  Spend the money and call in a licensed electrician who specializes in remodeling.   Too many sparkies only do new construction and are not electricians - they just work under one whom may or may not be on the job-site.  Furthermore codes are so different from area to area.  What works in Illinois, does not in California, and may not work in Alberta, or Japan.Best of luck to you with your new home. - DAVE"

1400,65968,how do i install a sump pump? ,1)The sump pit must be below the water source and be about 24 - 48 inches deep.  2) the water must have a path to the sump pit - gravel and clay tiles.  3)The sump pit must be lined to keep material from entering the pump - use plastic sump pit liner sold at Lowes/Home depot or form and pour a concrete pit -it can be round or square -approximately 24 inches in diameter. 4)There must be a place for the pump to dispose of the water - simply pumping it outside next to a foundation will not work - it will drain back down into the area you are trying to protect. The sump must discharge into a pipe or hose that discharges well away from area protected. 5) the electric sump pump must be plugged into a GFCI circuit. 6) The pump should have a back flow preventer in the discharge pipe immediately at the pump to prevent the water in the discharge pipe from re-entering the pit when the pump cycle stops. Sump pumps are sold by horsepower - 1/4; 1/3; 1/2 etc.  The size of the pump is determined primarily by how high you are lifting the water and how fast you want to lift it.

First, make sure you get the plumbing repaired first.  Simply replace the drain pipes under the sink.  I recommend replacing everything.  The parts are cheap and it is a lot easier to do it all.Seconds, using a jig saw or sawz-all (can rent at a tool rental place), cut the bottom of the cabinet out, leaving a few inches around the outside edges.  Cut a piece of plywood that fits inside the cabinet.  Set the plywood on the lip that you left when you cut the old base out.  You can screw the plywood down around the edge in a few spots and corners.  In order to get the plywood into the cabinet, you might need to cut it in half.  Just screw each piece down individually."

1418,17090,How do I find an honest car mechanic? ,"Well, I guess by the sounds of people here, I'm a rarity. I'm honest and good. I have never ripped a single person off and I now teach it at our local community college. The best advice is to be upfront with them. If you don't like their personality, go somewhere else. You really need to go in person to meet them, as often we are to busy to talk on the phone and are constantly bothered by price shoppers. it's just like finding a doctor you like. Sometimes you have to go to several of them to find one that your personalities mesh with. Once you find one, reward them with your loyalty. A good customer/provider relationship benefits both parties. We know your history of the car and you know we won't rip you off. We'll also know if we need to call you when repairs get expensive or if you are the type who doesn't need a phone call. Hope this helps. All you can do is try and see. Ask friends for local recomendations. In our area, dealers are the rip-offs, but in my parents area , it's the opposite. The independants are. It really varies by area."

1439,83337,How do you set a pendellum clock? Do you turn the weight down to speed it up or slow it down?,"There is a small knurled nut at the bottom of the pendulum. Turn it one way to speed up the clock and the other way to slow it down. If you grasp the nut in your right hand and move your thumb from right to left, you should slow the clock down because you are making the pendulum longer. Turning it the other way shortens the pendulum and speeds the clock up.Take very small adjustments in the nut, maybe a quarter turn or less. wait half day or so to see it the adjustment is too much or too little.I usually keep my mechanical clocks a little slow because it is easier to adjust the time by moving the minute hand forward rather than stopping the clock and waiting for time to catch up.CAUTION: Never try to move the minute hand backward and do not move the hour hand at all."

The pressure at your house is what it is and there isn't much you can do especially if you use city controlled water. If you are on a private well, you might be able to bump up the pressure at the pump. What you really are looking for is to increase the volume at the shower head. Removing restrictors is definitely one way. The only other practical way would be to increase pipe size which is probably not cost efficient."

You'll have to find out what works for you.Also, I assume you don't mean big pieces of concrete, but something smaller like dripping or splash from another project. Big pieces will need to be broken apart and manually moved out. You can rent an electric or pneumatic jack hammer, or use a sledge hammer.Very high pressure power washers (rental) can cut concrete.An angle grinder with various disks can scrape it away. For the lightest splash, a wire wheel in the angle grinder should work.Use goggles, leather work gloves and all recommended safety equipment when doing this.

1463,40741,How to replace a thermostat? Is it difficult? I'd like to switch from an analog to a digital thermostat that is programmable.,"Make sure the stat you purchase is made for your type of system. Many are built for various applications and may need to be programmed for your particular use. First, turn off power to your furnace to insure you do not fry your transformer. Then write down the connections to your old stat before disconnecting them. If you have enough wire, clip off the old ends and restrip the wires so they don't break off when tightening the terminal screws. Connect wires to the same terminals as the old stat. Usually (if you have A/C) the stat terminals will be marked r,w,g,y, and rc or common. There may be additional terminals for a stat that may also be for heat pump applications which would require wiring for a reversing valve. Attach the back plate (subbase) to the wall with appropriate anchors and use a small level before tightening the mounting screws in their slotted holes then simply connect the wires and plug the stat to the backplate. Turn the power back on and you are set to program.There are many different digital stats available. If you know someone in the HVAC business, for about 100 dollars Lennox and Honeywell both make excellent models with simple user interface which you can program from your easy chair then plug to the subbase.Whatever time program settings you use, give 1/2 hour lead time for temp change and do not program night setback more than 8 degrees. It takes more energy to reheat or recool the average home 10 degrees than you would save in energy by setting back. I also reccomend leaving the fan in always on mode when you can. This stops air stratification (uneven temps from flooor to ceiling) and provides maximum filtration. The models I mentioned have a 30% fan on setting to save energy and give better air filtration.If you live in a cold climate a good addition to your system is a duct mounted humidifier. Not only does it alleviate dry air problems such as static, and sinus dryness, you can heat at a lower temperature and still feel comfortableInstalling a new stat is not as difficult as it may sound, I'm sure you can do it, good luck."

1466,58635,how can I stop my car radiator from leaking? I want a cheap solution becuase it is not worth spending money replacing radiator,"All of those answers are good ones depending on how bad (big) the leak is.If is really small (pin-hole) then the pepper idea is best.  A little bigger but still not a crack then the egg will get you to the next town (it won't help you keep the vehicle alive while you sell it though).The stop-leak additives haven't proven to me to be worth much though.  You'll spend money on them for a poor and temporary fix at best when you really need to repair the problem.Ok, this again depends on size and location of the leak.If it's leaking at a solder joint, you might be able to remove the radiator and re-solder it without spending too much money...you'll need a good work area and a torch, acid core-flux, wire-brush and some solder.  Oh, by the way, you'll need some talent too.  Working with a molten metal can be a little dangerous for the uninitiated.I'd recommend a radiator rebuild shop or a junk-yard (PC--Vehicle Salvage yard).  New radiators are really spendy and you said the vehicle wasn't worth it.Cheapest way out?Since ""it is not worth spending money replacing the radiator"" I have the perfect solution:Drain the radiator dry (now it won't leak any more).  Don't ever drive it again.  Have it towed (or push it) to it's final resting place.  If it's not worth a radiator, it's not worth anything."

1469,121210,"How do I change a 3-way light switch out in a bathroom for a more updated look? It is currently beige, screws are missing from the plate. If complicated electricity isinvolved forget it. Thanks","Tools required: flashlight, phillips screwdriver, maybe wire cutters#1  TURN OFF YOU POWER AT THE FUSE BOX!!!!!!!!!#2  Remove old plate (should be really easy since the screws are missing!)#3  There should be 2 or possible 3 screws in the ""guts"" part of the switch.  One is silver, one is gold and might have one that is green.#4  Undo these screws and remove all of the parts to the old switch.  You should be left with 2 or 3 wires sticking out of the wall.#5 Install the new switch by attaching the white wire to the silver screw, black wire to the gold screw and green wire to the green screw - do not be alarmed if there is no green screw, this is only the ground wire and isn't required to have it function. (most old houses will not have them.)EASY TIP - you should already have the wires ready to attach to the new hardware, but if the wires are in bad condition (the individual copper wires are broken) you will need a set of wire cutters (they look like plyers) Cut the entire wire off as close to the end as you can while still removeing the damaged section.  Cut the colored plastic about 1/4 inch from the end and remove only the plastic section (do not cut the wires too)  Take the bundle of copper wires and twist them clockwise.  Place the bundle of twisted wires between the appropriate screw and the metal plate behind the screw.  Tighten the screw.  Repeate for the remaining wires.#6 Install the new plate on the outside of the switch#7 Turn the power back on & enjoy your handy work!It sounds like a lot but it only takes about 10 minutes!Good luck and if in doubt have a friend watch you do it to help talk you through the steps.Please e-mail me if you need clearification!"

1471,137695,how to reset the check engen light on a 1994 honda civic ex? ,"lol, I had a light come on my dash that said ""service engine"" and I thought it was the check engine light.  I just had to turn the car off, press and hold the trip meter button and start it with it held and wait 10 more seconds and the light went out.If it's really the check-engine light, you may have a problem.  These problems range from having the gas cap on loose to a major computer-engine interface problem.I have a scanner to see and diagnose those problems but you may have to go to a dealer to get yours.  First url below is a link to the trouble codes.  To see the codes do the following:""When the Check Engine warning light has been reported on, turn the ignition on, move the front passenger seat to the rear position and observe the LED on the front of the ECU. The LED indicates a system failure code by blinking frequency. The ECU LED can indicate any number of simultaneous component problems by blinking separate codes, one after another.If output indicates CODE 4, 11, 15, 16 or exceeds 17, count the number of blinks again. If the indicator is in fact, blinking these codes, substitute a known-good ECU and recheck If the indication goes away, replace the original ECU.""I'm guessing that you don't have a ""known good ECU"" anywhere so that means go to the dealer or your local trusted genius friend auto mechanic.Hopefully you find what's wrong by reading the ECU (Electronic Control Unit) blinks and flashes and this information will steer you in the right direction."
1472,111326,how do you use a lamp tester when wiring a trailer? ,"Most trailer wiring kits have you use the frame as the ground system. I recommend that you run an extra wire to each of the lights for the ground. The trailer chassis is not reliable when it gets old and weathered.With that said, you need to energize the plug with the vehicle that you plan to hook up to. Check the running lights when the parking lights are on, then the brake lights, then each of the directional signals.Also, your vehicle is not set up with a towing package you may need to change the blinker relay to a heavy duty type. The extra load may cause the directional signal lights to not work properly. They may flicker instead of flash."
1473,27430,how do i change a rear break cylinder on a picasso. is it worth replacing the seals? ,"To replace the wheel cylinder remove the return spring from one shoe so that pressure is released off of the cylinder. Remove the brake line and the usually two bolts that hold the cylinder to the backing plate. Bolt on the new one, reconnect the line and reattach the spring and bleed the brakes. I would rather replace the cylinder than rebuild it. Wheel cylinders are usually $15 or less. To rebuild it properly you would need a drill and a honing bit to remove imperfections from the cylinder wall. Even after doing all of this it still may leak."

Bring the thread up on the left and hook it in the metal piece there. Then down and hook in the little catch above the needle. Thread the needle and pull the thread under the presser foot.

1530,50208,how do I learn to maintain my pool? testing water and adding the right chemicals,"At the end of the pool season, you’ll need to make preparations to safely close your pool for the winter months. Talk to your dealer for the steps you need to take for your climate. The first step toward closing your pool should be to take a water sample to your Authorized Sustain® System Dealer. He’ll give you an end-of-the-season analysis and offer winterizing recommendations. Use Sustain Winterizing Products, designed to protect your pool against algae during the off-season, and make opening your pool next season a breeze. Simply follow these steps:Follow your dealer's instructions to adjust Total Alkalinity and other water balance factors during pool closing. You should have 1-3 ppm Free Available Chlorine (FAC) before proceeding to Step #2. Keep the pump running continuously for thorough mixing of chemicals until Step 3 is completed. Pour in Sustain Winter Shield® Chlorine Extender, using 32 fluid ounces for every 20,000 gallons of water. (Add only six fluid ounces if the pool has less than 7,500 gallons.) ""Superchlorinate"" your pool, using a double dose of Sustain® Shock Treatment (2 pounds for every 10,000 Gallons). Be sure to follow label directions to avoid bleaching of vinyl liners. Clean your pool, filter and all other mechanical equipment thoroughly. Partially drain your pool. Check with your Sustain® System Dealer to determine proper water levels and procedures for your climate. Cover your pool with a solid pool cover. Over the course of the pool season, many factors will change the balance of your pool water. When water is added to the pool, whether by rain or your garden hose, the pool water is diluted and the strength of the chemicals is lowered. Remember, the key to effective pool care is to maintain a balance: a change in one area will affect the overall balance of the chemicals. The main water balance factor that will need to be adjusted is pH. Frequent water testing is important to monitor pH and other water balance factors.Three-Way Test StripsAlternatively, use Three-Way Test Strips to routinely monitor pH, TA and FAC. Although extremely convenient, these strips are not as precise as a DPD Two-Way Test Kit. The Three-Way Strips indicate a range, instead of an exact reading. The pH level will read low if TA is 80 ppm or below. Also, the indicator for FAC is different than DPD (its purple, rather than pink), so the readings may differ slightly. When testing with the Three-Way Test Strips, handle the strips with clean, dry hands, keeping the bottle tightly capped between uses. Store in a cool place.Sustain® 3-Inch Blue Chlorinating Tablets are the general sanitizing components of the 3-part system. They are designed to deliver chlorine consistently when used with their skimmer dispenser cups. Each tablet contains a patented erosion modifier that controls erosion across the top (exposed surface) of the tablet. Fill the skimmer dispenser cup with 3-Inch Sustain® blue chlorinating tablets each week. Adjust the lid opening to increase or decrease chlorine delivery to maintain 1-3 ppm FAC. For in-ground pools, start with the lid off, and use it later, if necessary. For above-ground pools, start with the lid fully open and adjust as needed. Remember that chlorine demand increases with more direct sunlight, heat and greater pool use. Shield Energizer Tablets should be used once a week to act as both a shock treatment and means for keeping Sustain® Summer Shield Chlorine Extender charged with added chlorine protection. Unlike the 3-Inch tablets, Energizer does not contain an erosion modifier. The tablets are designed to dissolve quickly (usually within two hours). Add Shield Energizer Tablets each week. Remember to adjust pH to 7.2 (especially if it is 7.5 or higher) before adding Energizer Tablets. Add one cup per 5,000 gallons of water to the skimmer basket. After adding the Energizer Tablets, circulate continuously for at least 5 hours. Your wee"

1533,107527,How do I find a reliable exterminator who won't overcharge me? I have been invaded by rats.  My home methods have not worked so well.  Now I have a dead one I cannot locate that is making my life miserable.,"I would agree with the answer calling your local B.B.B  keeping in mind that you get what you pay for.Dealing with pest especially the larger brands(i.e. Rats)can be and is a frustrating and miserable task.First of all be honest with yourself,can you handle taking on the vermin? are you equipped to handle the outcome using pest control agents such as poison,etc.? are you capable of disposing the dead rats after extermination? By using professions who are equipped to handle the above questions are usually followed up with further treatments of the infested areas.If you should decide to take on the task yourself your first task would be to find the Food and Water source of your particular pest.Bait or trap would be the solution to irradication,keep in mind the safety of any pets you may have or children that could access the treated area.I work a ranch and I have to deal with pest invading the feed bins for my horses.Elimination of the food source will be your first move..give a couple days to see if you had any further visits(droppings,fresh foot prints, etc.)If you have, then the proper bait (Poison)can and should be purchased at your local Feed store that caters directly with issues concerning Ranch and Farm Pest and can help you in your choice as to which brand to use.Most of the poisons used are strycnine(sp)based to prevent odor from dead pest.Also if you choose to go the poison route Please keep any pets that you might have (dogs,cats)its not uncommon for dogs to eat dead rats or mice...and before you use baits such as this Please also consider the Natural rat traps that hunt these vermin(owls,Hawks,Eagles)keep check on the areas baited,and look for obvious signs of area use by the pest and proceed accordingly by either application of more poison or the removal of it if your problem has subsided.I quit the poison end of my problem as it worked okay, but it didn't eliminate it...I finally decided to get a couple of cats ...trading 1 pest for another, because cats can and do become a problem also if not kept in check.Its not the cats fault, but the people who owned them and no longer want the responsibility of them, and simply take them for a ride to the country and drop them off..Cats are domestic animals and are not like there counterparts that survive by the hunt.If you live in city,Cats would probably be your best ally, have them 'fixed'and give them love and food, a warm place to sleep, and they will address the rats,Once rats get the message a new 'Sheriff' is in town they soon vacate. I hope this helps and good luck!"
1534,32709,How to fix a leaky sink? It keeps dripping,"Will depend upon if your leak is at the faucet or the plumbing underneath the sink. ""Rebuild"" kits for the faucet are available at those large box home improvement stores. You'll need the manufacturer's name and model. Usually they contain the necessary o-rings, washers, etc. to fix most dripping faucets. Worst case is a replacement. You will probably not need any specialized tools, perhaps a hex key of the right size. Just follow the directions. Try to keep a rag between chrome surfaces and your tools to avoid scratching. Make sure you turn off the water, hot and cold, before you start and put a rag in the drain to avoid loosing small parts.The under the sink plumbing can be a bit of a bear depending on the material used. Plastic is really easy. Disassemble the trap (there's about a cup of water in there!) and check for cracks and worn gaskets. Parts are redily available at that same store. Make sure you have the correct size. Again, worse case, replace everything. Large slip joint pliers or a small pipe wrench may be required.In both cases, look for worn, cracked or pieces that have slipped. Generally it is more cost effective to replace gaskets, small pipes, etc. rather than trying to salvage something. The repairs are pretty easy. Go slowly, keep things in order for re-assembly and things should go fine.I make it a practice to ALWAYS WEAR SAFETY GLASSES, even while doing a job like this. Good luck!"

We cut out a piece of our wall in a suspicious area to see if there was anything and found tiny black dot on our 2x4's.  You can soap and water the boards down and a new spray made by Concrobium called mold control will kill fungi and prevent it from coming back (home depot has it) but you also have to fix the problem that provoked the problem in the first place. We have had to gut our entire basement and garage to change all the insulation to the new water resistant insulation and take the plastic off the concrete.  (that was our problem, double plastic barrier, is a no, no)  Find then fix but source out and have help on hand if needed.  Do not put a blind eye to this.

1560,55184,how do i install a lauan door? ,"Ok Tessiecom,  If the door you have is not a ""pre-hung"" door then you're in for a challenge.

The first website below will show you how to install a door that is pre-hung.  and the second will give you some ideas on what is involved in prepping the slab door before hanging it.  I hope this helps, and I will add more as I find it.The last link is a Lowe's link, it's pretty detailed.  Another thought I had is that a lauan door is generally hollow, which doesn't leave much wood around the outside edge of the door.  That translates into ""not much room for error""  especially where the mortising for hinges and beveling doors edge is concerned.  So one helpful hint- Measure Twice and Cut Once.  Good luck."

This is a 12 or 13 inch square ceramic tile in the kitchen that something was dropped on.,"The first thing you need to know is that unless you have spare tile from that exact dye lot, the chances of you matching the color of that tile is slim.

1582,99691,How do I replace the 2004 kia sedona cabin air filter? ,"Dont listen to people who say oh its only 2004, its new, you dont need to, your filter life depends on the air quality in your area, but a year, or 12,000 to 15,000 miles, typically is the recommended replacement interval. A cabin air filter may be in the outside air intake, visible with the hood up and perhaps a cover lifted. Or it will be under the dash in one or both of two general locations:• Above the blower in the back section of the outside air intake, a location well protected from moisture.• Between the blower and the rest of the HVAC case.If the owner's manual doesn't tell you the location, and you can't see it with the hood open, check behind the glovebox--perhaps you'll see an obviously removable (with a spring-tab or similar retainer) rectangular plastic cover. Next, look under the dash (on both the driver's and passenger's sides) for a removable plastic cover in the HVAC case. If you can remove its cover, look inside the HVAC case.Still no answer? Buy the filters, something you have to do anyway. You've got two choices:• Buy the factory filters at the dealership at full price. This way, you'll know for sure what they look like and get some idea about how they have to be installed. You'll also find out how many your vehicle has. The parts department should have a diagram to show you where the filters are located in the car.• Buy aftermarket filters that come with step-by-step instructions from an auto parts store. The odds of the original equipment parts coming with instructions are extremely slim. Do all aftermarket filters have them? No, but if you're shopping at a parts store, you should be able to check in the boxes on the shelves. Also, these parts probably will cost less.Replacing The Filters In The Air IntakeThe filter in the outside air intake (even if there are other filters) takes care of most of the dust and pollen, so it's likely to plug first.The typical procedure begins with removing the air intake screen, which is held by ""Christmas tree"" plastic fasteners. If the ""tree"" has a center pin, pry it up with a thin-blade screwdriver and then wiggle the tree out of the hole. If the tree is a single-piece design, you'll have to pry it out. Most of the time, it will break and you'll have to replace it (blister packs of replacements are sold in most auto parts stores).If there's a rain/snow deflector over the filter, remove it, then extract the element. The filter element may be held by a plastic tab, or it may slip into a retainer housing that you will reuse with the new element. Some dust may have gotten around or through the filter. Use a vacuum cleaner to clean the outside air intake duct. Be careful when you reinstall the air intake screen, as well as any cover over the filter element. If the gasket surface around the screen does not seal, or if the cover (actually a shield, in most cases) is not reinstalled, rainwater can flow into the filter, saturating it.In The Case, Above The BlowerIf the filter is in the case above the blower, most likely it is behind the glovebox. Removing the glovebox may be easy, but you may not have to remove it at all.Many filters (such as on most Hondas and Toyotas) are just above the blower behind the glovebox, and you'll have to drop it for access. In the best of cases, you can flex the sides of the box so the pins clear the dash, then pivot the box down for clearance. In others, the entire glovebox assembly has to come out, which means removing a number of retaining screws, not all of which are visible.The cabin filter is a type of air filter that in some respects--such as pleating to provide a lot of surface area in a small package--may resemble an engine air filter. However, it usually is made of different materials, the main one being a charcoal layer in many elements. Like some engine air filters, the dust and pollen filtering ele"

Where should I start? Library books? A weekend apprenticeship with a mechanic? The internet?Thanks for your help!",The only real way to learn is hands on. What you can do is go to a community college and take a few classes. Also try and get a job in a repair shop even if its only cahnging oil for a while. That way during the slow times you can try and spend time with the mechanics and give them anytype of help you can. you may be taking wheels of for the mechanic so he can due a brake inspection and before you know you are doing the brake inspections while he does other work and just keep trying to get in there. Also you can get a job as a service writer and from reading what the mechanics always right on the work order after checking a vehicle out you start see what types of vehicles always have the same symptons and problems constantly.

1628,92982,How to fix '91 Linc TC window cables in front doors.? Would like directions or URL for such.  Is it impossible?  Is there a trick?  DH having time w/them.,"If the cables have gone bad, they will have wrapped up around the drive spool, kinked, etc. Your only option there is to replace them. The part you need for that is called the ""window lift regulator"". Dorman makes aftermarket regulators that may fit your car. The motors also have a gear drive and the ""dogs"" sometimes strip out. I repair those by removing the motor, removing the plate over the drive head (one screw) clean out, and use 3 nylon nuts (solid nylon, not ""nyloc"") as the driv dogs.Here is how to on these types.Remove door panel and inner moisture barrier.Unplug motor connection and remove the three screws which hold motor in place, These may be ""Torx"" headed. Remove the motor from the door.To remove glass, you will need to do some drilling. Put window glass in a position where you can see the two rivets holding it to the regulator slide. Carefully use a punch to knock out the pin in each rivet, then drill rvet heat out. Remove the glass and lay aside (carefully of course). You will have to twist window, but it will come out. be sure to remove the inner ""wiping"" seal on the top of the door.Now all you have left is the regulator. It is held by two studs/nuts at the top, and two rivets ant the bottom which must also be punched, and drilled out.Reassembly is the reverse of removal. Instead of riveting back in place, I use 1/4"" blots, nuts, and lockwashers. On the glass, use bolts and Nyloc nuts, ore a plain nut held with epoxy on the threads. The white insulators snap together in the galss. The bolt goes through them. JUST SNUG UP THIS BOLT/NUT COMBO DO NOT OVERTIGHTEN!!!!!Ford dealer in my area quoted 435 bucks to repair one window on a Grand Marquis. I repaired all 4 last week for $180 labor, and about $135 in parts! Takes about 20 minutes per door."
1629,3967,How can I get super glue off the carpet? ,"Try here:  http://www.ehow.com/how_17787_remove-super-glue.htmlSuperglue (cyanoacrylate) has many uses. Besides the typical household function of sticking things together, it's used in surgical procedures and even in crime labs to develop unseen fingerprints. Originally marketed as Eastman #910 in 1958, this stuff is sneaky and it goes everywhere if you don't keep an eye on it.          Steps:  1.   Clean up any glue that is still wet by blotting it with a white paper towel or terry cloth towel.    2.   Soak the object in warm soapy water if possible and try rubbing off as much as you can.    3.   Pour a little bit of acetone-base nail polish remover on a white terry cloth.    4.   Dab at the dried glue until it dissolves.    5.   Use extra fine sandpaper to remove dried glue from the surface of an object.    6.   Try a product called Goof-Off or Z-7 Debonder.        Tips:   Hold a folded white cloth on the back of fabrics to keep the acetone from soaking through other layers.     Acetone may affect colors or melt plastic fibers, such as some nylons or carpet. Test it on a hidden area first.        Warnings:   Don't use solvents such as gasoline or paint thinner."

1678,137830,how do I fix a slow leak in my spa? Fix a leak isn't working.? ,"Before you begin make sure you have a leak! Spas lose a lot of water through evaporation. Fill the spa. Turn it off and let the water cool. Mark the water level. Leave it off 24 hours and mark the water level again. Measure the distance between the marks and record this measurement. Now, fill the spa to the original level and run- without heat- for 24 hours. Again, mark the water level and measure. Compare the measurements of ""off"" and ""running"". If they are close to being the same, you have no leak, as long as the water loss is negligable. Keep the cover on the spa throughout this process, as it will help to retard any evaporation. If there is a big difference in the measurements, then you have a leak. There are 3 possibilities:1). Spa loses more water running than off. That would be a return line (pressure) leak. Water is forced out under pressure when the pump is on.2). Spa loses more water off than running. Suction side leak. When the pump is on it will suck air in and slow down the amount of loss from water running out. Gravity flows out when the pump is off.3). Both water loss measurements are the same- running or off. That is structural. Leaking around a gasket or some such thing.Do the above and you will have eliminated 3 of 4 possibilities. Let me know which you have and I'll advise you further. Also need to know if the spa is fiberglass, concrete, etc.Hope this helps. We'll find the sucker!"

1680,79010,"How do I change a lamp from 220 V to 110 V? I have purchased some beautiful crystal lamps in Germany, but will need to change wiring and plugs when I return to the USA. I would appreciate information on what I need to buy and how accomplish this task.","As long as the power consumption of the fixture is not too high, like upto 200 watts, you just need to change the plug, the light bulbs to 110V type, and no need to change the wiring.  Normally, a 200 watt fixture running at 220V draws exactly 200/220 or less than 1 ampere.  So, if you power your fixture to 200 watts at 110 volts, the current will be 200/110 which is less than 2 amperes.  Normally they use a #16 or #14 wires in the fixtures...so, I think that should be okay.  Summary:  1) Change plug to North American standard  2) Change the light bulbs to 110v type... maybe you could get a lesser wattage to draw lesser current  3) Optional: Change wiring to #14.Good luck"

(as the head itself not an hand held) is there a converter fix or any way to connect a hose to this showerhead?","I don't quite understand your problem.  If you want to put a shower head directly onto the pipe that comes out of the wall, you should do the following:     1)  Remove anything currently attached to the pipe and any old putty, or tape from the threads that are there.     2)  Put a new band of teflon plumbing tape on the pipe.  It should be installed in a clockwise direction.          3)  Check for a round rubber gasket that fits into the shower head and put it inside the threaded fitting on the shower head.     4)  Hand screw the shower head onto the pipe, then tighten 1/4 to 1/2 turn with a wrench, put a cloth, or tape on the chrome fixture so as not to mar the chrome where you tighten the fitting onto the pipe.     5)  Start the water running, if the connection leaks tighten the shower head fitting very gently until it stops."

I want to regrout the tiles in the shower/tub area and also recaulk but I don't know what the first step is or what I should buy from the hardware store.  Can anyone help?  Thanks a bunch.,"Certainly the removal of old grout is the first step. You don't state its condition, or if you just want to change a grout color?   Its a messy job, or can be, and care to not break any tiles.   Re grouting: When you go to a home store you will see various colors certainly, and two types of grout usually,,,SANDED and NON SANDED. One applied and dry either will work, the differences are in the width of grout lines,,, IE: Non sanded recommended for wider lines.   Mix only small amounts at a time, apply with a plastic putty knife if you don't want to invest in a runner face trowel, buy the wipe off sponge, allowing for the grout lines to be filled to overflowing, gently, with a DAMP sponge, wipe away excess. As the grout sets and dries you can apply a wetetr sponge in cleanup. The dust left behind once dry is easily wiped away.   You might also buy sealer, for the grout allowing it to be less absorbent, though I have no stats on effectiveness.Rev. Steven"

1697,37825,how do i not get cheated by a home contractor? ,"I used to be a Tin Man...I know how to answer this.  Getting a number of estimates is a good idea, as the person above suggests.However...knowing your own budget and the value of the service you desire in advance of getting estimates is the most powerful way to control the circumstances.Try these steps:1. Make sure your contractor has a few jobs under his belt.  Its not that I want to dissuede a talented company from getting a start, but you need to know that they can complete a job.  Obviously the longer they have been around the better.2. Naturally check their reputation out with the Better Business Bureau (if you live in the U.S.)3. Here is the strongest point:Know the value of the labor and materials you want to put into the project.  Here's how: - In today's world you can take your sketches to any Home Depot, Lowes and most high end consumer home improvement stores and get them to estimate the materials needed to go into your job.Lets say you are working on a new single car garage.  Altogether Home Depot estimates your cost for a 24 x 24 single car garage to be around $6500.00.  That doesnt include getting the slab dug and poured or the labor to build it.If you have three contractors come in with prices ranging from $12,000 - $25,000 and you know the materials would only cost $6500, FIRST - you need to know what each one is giving you...and then start looking at why the high price is so high.  If its high because they are giving you more, then have them re-bid it WITHOUT the extras.  If its high for no other reason then they are trying to make too much money off of YOU... - Basically, if you know the materials and someone can help you figure out what the labor would cost, then YOU tell the contractor what YOU can afford and DO NOT SWAY FROM IT.So here's how I do it know.  I know I've got a project to build that costs $5,000 in materials.  I figure out that the labor is usually 2/3 of the estimate, so I do my own estimate (more of a guestimate sure) which comes out at $15,000.  THEN I insure that I can afford that cost.THEN I get the estimates.  Whoever has the best experience, best reputation and comes closest to my budgeted number is the contractor I would choose.4. DO NOT close on your deal on the same day the salesman calls on you.  There are some HARDCORE closers out there who MIGHT actually represent good companies, but are only out to line their own pockets with your money with a quick sale.  The background language they use for a person who buys on the same day is a ""mooch"" - which means you are an easy mark to jack up the price and get a financed sale the same night.  Mooches DO NOT know what things cost.  They don't know materials, they don't know labor and they will sign without reading the contract all the way through.Take a day to read all the proposals - MAKE SURE there is language in the contract that protects YOU the consumer.If you do sign, DON'T FORGET - you have a THREE DAY RIGHT OF RECISION - in most or all states of the US.  Meaning that the contract isn't even VALID until 72 hours AFTER you signed it.Some of the old school tin men I worked for used to ""spike"" the job.  That means that EVEN THOUGH the recision time wasn't up, they would pull a building permit and put it in the customers window to distract the customer from considering a contract cancellation.Watch for strange behaviors like that.One more thing I remember from my experience.If a salesman calls back to the main office having a ""discussion"" with the home office, it MIGHT be real...OR...he is having a fake conversation (even if its a pretend one with his boss) where they talk about ""saving you money"" with some materials they have ""left over"".  This is UTTER BULLSH*T.  The price has already been jacked up and they are allowing you to feel a sense of false victory in ""talki"

I'm confused about whether I have to turn off the water.  Which pipe to turn, etc.   Thank you.","No need to turn off any water,,, At least not initially.   The ""P"" trap under the sink is the place to begin, and should be easy to remove,,,using care certainly. The pipe that is the curved one...   You may be able, with just a large lock jaw pliers, to unscrew the connections.   Once apart flush the P trap with a hose or scoop out as much as you can of any debris... OR buy another.   The P trap is designed not only to trap gases/odors that may intrude from drain lines, but also manages to collect most everything else that fits down the drain.   If there is something wedged,,IE: hair pins etc, use a wire coat hanger to force the object out.   When replacing wou should have at hand new washers/gaskets to put back when connecting. You might also purchase the thread tape to ensure a better seal. Carefully rethread the connectors to the threaded down drains, assuring a tight fit, but not extreme fit, and turn on the tap.Rev.

1739,21978,how do i get rid of ants without buying a book on the net or buying any poisons? ,"What to do about ants without using poison?We Should not Poison Ourselves, Kids and PetsIt's a good idea to let ants know that yours is not their house, without killing them. For ants are very helpful to keep this earth clean. Using poison, we only poison ourselves, too, even when we do not realize it. Yet, a toxic effect can be seen immediately on life energy photographs after the use of poisons.Different PreferencesIn my experience, it depends on the type of ants what they like least.What can be Used?I have used cinnamon, peppermint, cayenne or citrus oils. Ants have a very sensitive sense of smell, and these items are too strong for them so that they avoid these. For some reason, some ants do not like cucumber rinds, grated and sprinkled around.Someone CheckingWith natural means we may not hinder all ants to come in, but most. They may be always a few ants just checking out our facility. If there is nothing they need, they do not call their armies to carry off the booty.Ants as Our EducatorsHelping us clean, the ants assist us to be very clean if we do not want their help. At least, they themselves do not poison us.Discourage Them Inside, but Give the Ants What They NeedWhat worked best for me is to distribute some of the above mentioned items around and in the house, and give the ants what they need outside the house.Knowing the WeatherBefore the rain they need oils and may find them when stove or floor are not cleaned. The ants know when the rain storm is coming before the weather man may know it. I have watched this for many years. They suddenly come in, in greater numbers, looking for oil, even on the pillow sheets, if they do not find it outside the house! The oil is needed to make their chambers waterproof! Especially in dry years they do not find enough sap of trees to meet their needs, and they enter the grease spotted house to meet their needs.Give Them What They Need - OutsideWhen the ants come in, in greater numbers, I know that a rain storm will come, although the sun is shining and no real cloud is in the sky. Then I place sheets of paper towel, soaked in olive oil, outside by the house, but a few yards away. This way the ants can smell the oil on their way to the house but are not attracted to the house directly. I hold the oiled pieces of paper towel down with some rocks. This way the ants can easily get the oil and walk off happily, leaving the house alone. One or two may still come in, but that's no problem. They are just checking.Ants like Seeds and StarchSprinkling sunflower seeds around also helps to keep the ants busy. A bag of bird seeds may be $4 and lasts a long time. It takes the ants some effort to carry off one seed, although the birds may gladly help to eat the seeds.The Queen KnowsOften, I wondered how the ants know what's in the house, where the sources are and when. Science found out that they have a psychic queen, who intuitively knows where the needed resources can be found. Amazing. Even when the ant queen was away from the ant home, she could still send her telepathic messages to the ants.Ants - the Garbage CrewImagine we had no ants on earth, ants who chew up the empty beetle shells. We would be swamped with these beetle shells, for they do not decay easily. The ants, like other animals in their own ways, take care of many other things for us, so that the earth stays clean.Let Them LiveFor that reason alone I think we need to be kind to the ants and tell them in a gentle way that we don't want them in the house, but let them live outside!A Stone Setting for the AntsI never had a major problem with ants as long as I gave them outside what they needed. A small stone setting may be sufficient to place some fruit scraps, bread crumbs, seeds, sugar items etc. out for them. They will be so busy, carrying these items off. I place some fist size rocks in a circle, with spaces between them, and cover the "

This will shut off the water to the whole house.  Then open the faucet at the lowest point of the house, then one at the highest point of the house, it will drain to the lowest point.  Do what you have to do, then shut the lowest point faucet off.  Open the incoming water valve, slowly, with the highest point still open; this will purge any air in the pipes.  Check for leaks.

Battery seems to be working, has lights, radio etc.","Just because the car's lights work doesn't necessarily mean the battery is fine.Does the car turn over? A starter motor (electrical) actually turns your engine when you are trying to start your car. If when you put the key in and try to start the car and you hear no sound at all, or maybe a click and then no sound, it would either be your starter motor has died and it needs to be replaced, or your battery can't give enough amps to the starter motor to start up the car.I would recommend doing this in this order.1. Check the fluid level in the battery. If the fluid is low in the battery fill with distilled water up to the necessary levels.2. Have someone try to jump start your car with a pair of jumper cables. Let the good engine run for a minute to try to place a charge in your battery. If your car starts up, then the battery is what was dying, or you were low on electrolyte (what the water you added to the battery becomes). Drive the car for about 10 minutes to charge up the battery. Don't use any accessories if possible (ie turn off radio/head lights and anything electrical). If you turn off your car and it starts back up, your done.If trying to jump start the car and it doesn't turn over or all you hear is a ping or click sound, then your starter motor is most likely the problem.

1770,16759,"How do I know if something was built with pressure treated wood? I just bought a house with a deck. Now I find out there is termites in the wood. I have to replace the deck, but I'm wondering if the footings would be ok to re-use if they were made with pressure treated wood. I don't know if you can tell by the color, or if you can tell at all. Any advise is welcome.","From what I understand, wood species commonly pressure-treated in the southeast US doesn't need injection holes.  That may be why Untouchable has never seen them.  The species used in the west (where I live) DO need injection holes (staggered parallel rows of half-inch long cuts).  Most PT stuff here is over-dyed brown, to get rid of the green tint from the chemicals.  And wood treated with CCA is no longer legal to sell in the US.  ACQ is a common substitute.  The new PT chemicals are more caustic than CCA, and require use of fasteners, straps and brackets with thicker layers of galvanizing.  Just replace everything--you'll take a big risk leaving the old stuff in place, and won't save much money.  The building codes in your area should be designed to prevent termite infestation, requiring metal shielding and no wood-to-earth connections, for example.  Follow them."

1778,114735,how do  I recharge the air-conditioner on my dodge pickup? ,"I totally agree with ""thefarmersson"" in the above post.  If an A/C system requires recharging, that means that there is a leak in the system.  A/C systems are closed systems that should never need to have additional freon added.  Unfortunately, the parts stores that sell freon don't really stress that a proper diagnosis needs to be made prior to adding additional freon.  Make sure you have repaired the leak in the system prior to adding additional freon.  Assuming that you have already done so, you will need the following: a vacuum pump and preferably a set a of r134a gauges or r12 gauges depending on your year model.  The purpose of using a vacuum pump is twofold.  It helps get all of the moisture out of the system and by pulling a vacuum on the A/C system, you can verify that your repair to the leak in the system is fixed.  To verify that your repair worked, hook up your A/C gauges to the service ports and proceed to operate your vacuum pump.  After running the vacuum pump for 20 minutes, your low side a/c gauge should indicate that the system is under about 30"" of vacuum.  Shut off the vacuum pump.  Let the vehicle sit for about 20 minutes and then come back and check the status of your gauges.  If the low side gauge returns to 0 psi, or ""atmospheric pressure"" it means that outside air entered your a/c system and brought the pressure back up to atmosperic pressure, indicating a leak.  If this occurs, there is no point to charging the system with more freon because it will just leak out, and you will have to go back to the drawing board and attempt to find another leak.  However, if the gauges remains close to 25"" to 30"" of vacuum, the system is ready for charging.  Hook up a can of freon to the yellow charging line on your a/c gauges.  With the engine off, open up the charging port on the yellow charging line and then open the low side port on your a/c gauges.  This will allow freon to start flowing from the can into your car's a/c system.  Once the freon stops flowing, turn on your truck's engine and a/c system.  The a/c compressor should kick on and start sucking more freon from the charging can.  If the compressor does not kick on, there is an electrical problem present, which would be a totally different subject.  Basically, after the compressor kicks on, continue charging more freon into the system through the low side of the a/c gauges until your gauges indicate about 30-35psi on the low side and 200-250psi on the high side.  If everything is working properly, you should experience a 40 - 45 degree a/c vent outlet temperature.  If this all sounds too complicated, I would reccommend taking the vehicle to a reputable technician in your town who has the proper equipment to do the job.  I don't reccommend these quick charge kits that the parts stores sell because they do not include pressure gauges so you don't know if you over or undercharged your system.  Proper operating pressures are essential for proper operation."

1789,107279,how do you tell how many poles a altenator has? ,"2, 4, 8, 16 .....Alternator Secrets Created 01/15/00 Anozira Updated 02/04/02 http://members.1stconnect.com/anozira ALTERNATOR SECRETSAUTHOR UNKNOWN - DATE UNKNOWN INTRODUCTIONIn the last two decades alternators have replaced generators in motor vehicles. The reasons are many: output current can be produced at lower rpm, voltage can be more accurately' controlled with solid state regulators, alternators need less maintenance, and they cost less to manufacture.When modified, auto alternators can provide variable direct current at 0 to 120 volts for battery charging, hot charging, light arc welding, or for running AC-DC appliances and lights. Another simple modification provides AC power to run some transformer-operated appliances. If you know the secrets of its operation and the modifications possible, the small low-cost alternator can become a versatile power plant.BASIC CONSTRUCTIONThe old-fashioned generator contains a wound stater which produces a constant magnetic field in which a revolving coil of wire, called an armature, turns. A commutator on one end of the armature made up of many individual brass segments passes the generated current to the outside world through carbon brushes.Because commutator segments must be electrically insulated from one another, they can not be fabricated from a single -block of metal. Each commutator segment must be individually attached to the armature shaft. This is a source of mechanical weakness. When the armature is rotated at high RPM, centrifugal force can cause the commutator to explode, throwing segments in all directions.To prevent explosions, the generator is usually driven at less than engine speed. An auto engine may turn 5000 RPM, but the generator must be geared to a maximum 2500 rpm for safety's sake. As a result, the generator turns so slowly at low engine rpm that it produces little or no current. A modern alternator, like the generator, contains both moving and stationary coils of wire. In the alternator, however, the moving coil, called the rotor, uses current supplied through slip rings to generate a moving field. Power is extracted from the stationary field coils.Slip rings replace the weak generator commutator. The rotor coils themselves are encased in a strong soft iron shell making the whole assembly much stronger than the generator armature. The net result is that alternators can be driven to much higher speeds without danger of explosion. In fact, alternators are usually driven at up to twice engine speed some running at 8000 rpm or more. At low engine rpm the geared up alternator turns much faster than a comparable geared down generator. The net result is that the alternator can begin producing useful charging current at lower engine rpm than can the generator. A coil of wire rotating in a magnetic field produces an alternating current with a frequency dependent on how fast the coil turns, one cycle being produced per revolution. A generator armature uses a commutator to mechanically switch rotating windings in and out of automobile's electrical system to produce direct current.The three separate stationary windings of the typical auto alternator produce three-phase alternating current. Rather than use a commutator to mechanically convert AC to DC, the alternator uses six diodes in a full-wave bridge rectifier circuit. In essence the diodes are solid state switches with no moving parts, making them maintenance-free and explosion proof.The alternator output voltage can be controlled or regulated by varying the rotor current. Regulators sample the output voltage and automatically change the intensity of the rotating magnetic field by adjusting the current fed to the rotor through the slip rings. The adjustments are made in such a way so as to bring the output voltage to the desired level.THREE-PHASE POWERSurprisingly, alternators are constructed with three sets of field wi"

1799,136749,How do you remove white (salt?) deposits from the brick on a house?

Mopping is fine only if you are using a wood floor mop.  They can be found in any hardware store, Wal-mart etc.  They are a flat version of a mop and use less water.  you should never use excess water on wood floors.  I have seen many wood floors damaged this way.  You could try to rinse with just plain water to remove build up or use water with some white vinegar (vinegar is acidic and an effective way to rinse soap build up & a good home remedy) you can also buy a store bought rinsing agent which would be a higher grade acidic cleaner.  If your floor is dull due to wear there are some products you can buy off the shelf to restore wood floors that are inexpensive but they are really just short term solutions, they usualy are a wax of some kind.  The best way to get the shine back of a worn wood floor is to sand and re-finish.  Which is best left to a pro unless you are very handy (then you can rent everything nessesary at most hardware stores).As for on going maintenance for hard floors, do not use excess soap and only use a neutral soap, better yet clean often using only water or very little soap.

1827,5911,How do I protect myself while hiring a contractor.? I plan to hire a contractor for new siding and roofing and want to insure that I'm not libel in case one of the contractors has an accident etc.,"First, to protect yourself from liability (not libel--that's different), hire a licensed contractor who is insured.  Ask for proof of both--he will be able to produce his current contractor's license and proof of up to date insurance and worker's comp.Second, take the time to read his contract.  If you can't understand it, spend a few dollars to have an attorney review it.Third, ask for references and call them.  It's important to understand that building and remodeling projects NEVER go as planned, so don't be surprised if all the references were disappointed in something.  But, you should focus questions on his overall character, not on the project itself.Finally, when you select a contractor, ask him some of these questions:How long do you think this project will take?What things could make it take longer?If it lasts longer, will that cost me more?Is there anything I can do to make it faster?What are some surprises you've had in the past on similar projects?How did you solve those?A good contractor will appreciate these questions, and will take the time to talk to you about them.  With this, you will have an understanding of what he's about to do, which will establish a good relationship with him.  That's just about the best protection you can get!"

1829,90848,how do you hook up battery cables? ,"Steps:  1.   Determine that a dead battery is the reason your car is not starting. If the engine cranks when you turn the key, the problem is not the battery and jump-starting won't help. If the windshield wipers, lights and heater blower all work, the battery is probably fine and you may have a bad starter. A jump-start won't help if you have a bad starter. If you hear no sound at all when you turn the key or if the engine cranks very slowly and the accessories do not work, then you have a dead or low battery and it's time to break out the jumper cables. You'll need a flashlight if it's dark outside.    2.   Find someone with a running car that can give yours a jump.    3.   Open the hoods on both cars and determine where the batteries are. Park the booster car (the one that's running) so that the batteries are adjacent.   4.   Turn off the booster car.    5.   Attach the red jumper cable's end to the positive terminal on the dead battery. Use a rag to wipe the battery clean if you can't see the Pos or plus (+) sign on the battery. The positive terminal is always slightly larger than the negative one.    6.   Attach the other end of the red cable to the booster battery's positive terminal.    7.   Attach the black jumper cable's end to the booster battery's negative terminal.    8.   Attach the other end of the black jumper cable to a ground on the dead car's engine; any solid metal part works fine. You may see a small spark when you attach the last end. This is normal.   9.   Turn on the booster car and rev the engine.    10.   Turn on the dead car. If it doesn't start, you may have a poor connection at any of the four cable ends. Jiggle each cable end and try starting the car again.  It may take a bit of letting the car sit while the dead battery builds a small charge.    11.   Once the car starts, disconnect the cables in reverse order of attachment: negative, negative, positive, positive.    12.   Keep the engine running on the jumped car for at least 20 minutes or longer so the alternator has sufficient time to recharge your battery.         Overall Tips:   Always store a set of jumper cables in the trunk of your car.     Holding up jumper cables indicates clearly to passing motorists that you need a jump--but stay safely out of the road when you do so.     When buying jumper cables, choose a set that is at least 8 feet (2.5 m) long; this makes it easier to connect the two cars.       Overall Warnings:   Do not reverse the polarity. Make sure the cables are attached as described, to avoid damaging your car's electrical equipment or causing the battery to explode."

1836,35442,How do I inflate the air ride suspension on a lincoln mark VII? The rear on the car will inflate but the front end wont.,"There are a few ways to infate your suspension. First why is it low and where? In front or back or both? Oh sorry, you said fronts only, Are both low, if so your bags are leaking more then likely.Did you raise the vehicle without turning off the suspension switch in the trunk ? Or did they deflate themselves? Usually when they deflate themselves, you have a leaking airbag or line, or even a bad pump, but you said the rears inflate right? So then the pump is probably ok. You can inflate the airbag system automatically by running the engine for a while, BUT, If you have a source leak like a blown airbag, they might not re-inflate. Or use the NGS, WDS, Snap-On scanner or OTC for that fact to turn the pump on and open the air switches at the air bags. Older Lincolns had a air inflate valve on or near the pump. It looks like a tire valve stem. I not sure but I do not think that the Mark VII's have one. Do you hear the air pump running? when you turn on the Key? You can try and put a floor jack under the vehicle on the side that is low, Jack it up alittle bit, then turn the car on for a little while. This might help to raise it by themselves. Listem carefully near the air bags for an air leak. Use a soapy spray solution like your dishwashing soap mixed with water in a squirt bottle and spary the bags down and look for bubbles. If you live in the South Bay area ( Santa Clara Ca ) I can help yo fix the problem. Good luck. Magikmann"

Insert a chisel under the bottom of the window, and as you force the chisel in, the window will break the seal, and move upwards.If you have windows that seal below the sill, take a hammer, and a piece of wood, and a cloth.

I think that there is a break in the wire underground. I'd like to find the break, dig it up, repair it, re-bury it.

Make sure your testing correctly.If the house was built within the last 5 years, the back fill around the foundation has settled and put a lot of strain on the wire as well as the water pipe coming from the well. I would dig down 4 feet at the outside wall where the wire enters the foundation wall. However it's hard to believe that 12/2 Romex type wire would suffer enough tension force to break. Usually it's the water pipe that breaks at the wall and springs a leak. I'd recheck the voltage at the well head."

1857,124057,how can i restore my basement after a flood? my basement flooded and have of the thing are distroyed. how can i get all that water out. it's at least 5 inches.,"First go buy a submersible pump (sump pump) and hose to get the water out.  If you have a window in your basement you can put the hose thru the window.  Make sure to drain the water far enough away from your home so it does not just leak back down into the basement.  Next you should pull out anything that was submerged in water and discard it.  This includes carpeting, furniture, etc.  If there is drywall on the walls, you may be able to salvage most of it by cutting a line all the way around the room 12"" above the waterline and reinstalling a new strip.  Once everything is cleared out, get some dryers and dehumidifiers down there and let them run for 3-4 days.  Longer if need be.  A few nice days will help too.  Open windows if you can, as moving air helps alot.  When you think its dry enough to move things back in test the slab by taping down some clear plastic (2'X2') in the middle of the concrete floor.  Leave it taped down overnight.  If there is any condensation on the inside of the plastic the next morning, you need to keep the blowers anddehumidifiers working longer.  You may rent the dehumidifiers at your local rental yards or Home Depot. Finally, you should deal with the reason your basement flooded to begin with.  Adequate rainwater leads usually help to prevent this.  You can also dig french drains around the foundation to drain away excess water before intrusion into the structure.  Type in ""french drainange"" on Yahoo search for more info.  Good luck, hope this has helped."

1859,64155,How do I Balance my twin SU's and how do I stop her running rich (Triumph TR7 V8 3500). Thanks.? ,"As a owner of a Range Rover and two Disco's I have to say I am supprised to hear that the speedy TR7 has twin carbs.For a book I would suggest you go to the LRO site, or buy one of their mags and look through the too many adverts and you will find books on offer along with many specialty shops that love to work on rover V8s.If you would like to get driving there is a rough and ready way. Pardon me if I miss some points as my book is not with me.Here we go:  Make sure you have just the PROPER amount of oil in each carb chamber, Make sure the linkage is or cable is adjusted so both carbs function as close to as alike as you can determine, now the fun part.Find  yourself some of that small 8mm or so clear plastic hose, about 3/4 of a meter in length get two if you can. Start your engine, put the hose near your ear (one end) and the other end just down the throat of the carb-Forgot to mention you need to have the aircleaner off.  You will hear the hissing of the fuel jet as the engine runs. Listen to each carb in turn.  You objective is to get the sound exactly the same as much as your calibrated ear can allow.Set the idle screws on each carb the same number of turns (remember to count how they were set. Now set the each carb bit by bit to get the engine idle to 600 or so RPM. Keep the sound the same between each of the carbs.The models of SU's on my Range Rover have fuel adjustment screws which I then cut them back till the engine goes rough and then open them evenly (to the sound) untill it goes smooth.  Check your work by reving the engine and listening you may have to fiddle one carb or the other just a little to keep the sound and have smooth exceleration.This can be really fustrating as things like big changes in humidity and temperature effect the fuel tuning.You may find it much more satisfying to take it to a reputable garage and watch as you wax on about the pleasures of owning a classic automoble or even less stress than that, ask when you can pick it up and if it is not too long spend the time in a pub-having lunch of course you should not drink and drive.Good Luck."

1869,103688,how do i drain my electric hot water tank ? ,"Pretty much the same way you drain a gas, oil, propane water tank. There should be a valve at the bottom, it will have a spout with standar threads, the same threads that a standard garden hose uses. connect a gargen hose to the spigget or the valve with the threads, route the hose to where ever you want the water to drain too. Then gently, very very gently open the valve. If you happen to have a water tank with a plastic spigget/valve then you might be screwed. If it's a really old tank the plastic may have dried or rotted to the point it's so weak that an attempt to open it might just snap off the valve completly. If you do have a plastic valve and if it's really old, I would get your friends to help and gather buckets. Average tank size is probably 20 -50 gallons, if the valve snaps and the tank is full then all the contents of the tank will come gushing out. If the valve snaps, it's no biggie to replace it and it's cheap. It's not all that bad, most times it's a breeze but you have to be prepared for the worst."

This became apparent when I had foundation work done and the house was raised - instead of fixing the foundation, the previous owner had the doors shaved to fit - and now of course they're showing gaps on top and not fitting at all!  The doors themselves are lovely, and I don't really want to replace them, but rather build them up again and paint them over.  Do you know what I mean?  Any suggestions?  Needless to say, I'm not all that brilliant at that sort of thing, so anything reasonably easy would be appreciated.","Some people would suggest using that ""plastic wood"" wood putty to build it up but that stuff looks unnatural and you won't like the outcome. Here's an idea. Take off the door and use a plane or sander to make it square and even all the way around. Then re-hang it and you should have an even gap all the way around. You can then take a thin piece of wood (same type of wood, of course) in the right thickness to fill in the gaps. Cut it to the right length, glue it in place, secure it with a few tiny finish nails, sand it so it's flush with the rest of the door, then paint or stain to your heart's content. This is the short version of the process, but I think you get the idea. Don't use that wood putty/plastic wood stuff, it's messy and looks bad. Good Luck."

This clay is available at auto parts stores and you can use it to start your oxidation.another suggestion, you can use a prewax cleaner or a liquid oxidation remover for removing dead paint and oxidation. Another thing you can try is a rubbing compound and you just rub in on in a circular motion and then wipe it off.After you use the clay or rubbing compound, you need to cover it with a coat of wax to get the scratches back out that the rubbing compound causes. It will give the paint its luster back."

They are installed based on the weight of the door, desired rate of closure, etc. If your door is not closing fast enough, then one of the springs is probably broken and will require replacing the hinge. If it's closing to fast, best bet is to replace the hinges with ""lighter"" units.

1933,114178,How to change oil in a '98 Stratus ? I need to do it for my self.? ,"Piece of cake.  Just have all the tools ready before oil is pouring out of the oil pan.  RAGS RAGS RAGS(can't have too many)  Correct size wrench, two gallon tub or something with high sides to minimize splash, oil filter wrench.  You can go to your local auto parts store to get the right amount and grade of oil.  Get a new filter too.  Warm up the oil by running to the auto store.  This ensures you get most of the contaminants out of the oil pan, which is the whole idea behind oil changes.  You're going to have to get under the car.  I prefer ramps, if you can get some they're lots easier to mess with than jacks.  You can rent these pretty cheap.  Have a little tub that will hold a couple gallons or so.    Figure what size wrench fits on the plug.  Un-screw the plug (lefty lucy righty tighty).  Be careful the oil is warm!!  Just let the plug and all go into the tub...you can fish it out later.  Let the car drain real good.  Then take off the oil filter.  You might need a filter wrench.  When installing the new filter just use your hands.  If you insist on using a wrench go easy...overtighen it and you will be sorry when it gets warm.  Don't forget to put a little oil on the new gasket on the filter. Here's where I usually screw up...don't forget to put the plug back in the pan.  After that is done carefully pour the four of five(depending on your vechicle) quarts of oil back into the top of the engine.  Start the car up and look at it real good.  Let it run a while and see if it leaks anywhere.  Now that the oil filter has oil in it you will get an accurate reading on the dipstick.  You might want to back the car off the ramps or let it down if you had it up on stands so the car is level.  Turn the car off and check the oil again to be sure its right.  Shouldn't take you more than a couple hours taking your time...Hope this helps..."
1934,118600,How do i install strobe lights on a car? ,"Strobe Lights can be purchased at many auto parts locations.  They are however, illegal to operate while the vehicle is in motion.  Impersonating an emergency vehicle.  To install one, you need to put it someplace where it won't get wet.  Most of them that I have seen, would simply drill a small hole on the inside of an existing turn signal housing.  Make it the same size or slightly larger than the strobe light itself.  Then you just put the strobe in the hole and seal with silicone to prevent water leakage.  Then wire it to a switch to turn on.  Basically it's as easy as installing a new light.  Like I said though, don't get caught using it on the road."

1941,73688,How can i get rid of the smell of sewage? Er no hands of mine are going to unblock that?,"if you have lingering smell of sewage in your home - the first thing to do is to make sure that none of your plumbing traps have evaporated.  Traps are designed to always have a level of water in them in order to prevent sewer gases from travelling up into the home.Go to each shower, tub & sink and run the water for a few seconds.  Additionally, if you have a toilet which has no water in it, yet is still hooked up to the plumbing, pour water into the toilet bowl until there is water sitting in the toilet bowl.  This will ensure that the trap will be filled.If a fixture (sink, tub, shower, toilet) goes unused for a certain amount of time, the water in the trap will eventually evaporate thus making for a clear path for the sewer gases to make their way into the bathroom, kitchen, etc.  If you still have the smell of sewer gases after doing the above, have a plumber check your sewer system outside, if you have a private system (non-public).  You also might have a filled septic tank which needs emptied.  Logically, this will eventually occur for everyone who has a septic tank since all collection tanks eventually need emptied.  If all your in-house plumbing is working correctly and your septic tank is not full and backed-up, then you should not be encountering sewer gases.  Also check your garbage disposal:  certain rotting foods in the bottom of sink drains tend to smell like a sewer.  Again, do a good cleaning and regular cleaning of all your drains to avoid this.  Also, unless you have a working garbage disposal, do not let solid food make it's way down your drain.  Food items can easily get stuck and thus start the rotting process while it's still within smelling range."

It's not like I can take my dryer hookup with me when I decide to move out. So it's like a waste of money!! Any suggestions??Please Be detailed. Or if you're an electrician and live in oakland county Michigan, I'll pay you a reasonable rate to come hook it up for me. Thanks","First,since you rent,there may be a clause in your rental agreement that does not allow for these appliances in your apartment.This can be solved by simply asking the landlord of the apartment complex.If this is the case,the point is mute.If this is not the case then have them do the work or have it done by an electrician. The reason I say this is that installing a 220V outlet for a dryer most likely involves more work than you want to do yourself....cutting into the wall,getting wire in the wall,wiring the outlet and the breaker panel,installing a dedicated breaker,repairing the wall,and don't forget the dryer has to be vented,etc..If you are allowed to have a dryer in the apartment,you might try finding a 110V portable unit that you can simply plug into an existing outlet.Hope this helps."

1985,123158,How do i find my low pressure line on my  98 buick park ave a/c system? ,"Mr. plevine, you first have to determine whether your system uses R-12 or R134a before servicing or troubleshooting it. How do you know whether the system in your vehicle uses R-12 or R-134a? LOOK FOR SPECIAL INDENRIFICATION DECALS OR LABELS ON THE MAJOR COMPONENTS.What else should you look for? The high-side low-side service fittings on an R-134a system are completely different from those used on an R-12 system.On an R-12 system, the high-side service fitting is a 3/8-inch 24 for screw-on couplers; the low-side fitting is a 7/16inch 20 (also known as 1/4-inch flare fitting) On an R-134a system, the high-side and low-seide service fittings are special 1/2-inch Acme-type fittings with no external threads. They have internal threads, but they're for the specially-designed caps unique to R134a fittings. Mr. plevine look for a RED-CAP for high-side BLUE-CAP for the low-side. Be mighty-careful when you service airconditioning system.GOOD LUCK!"
1986,83412,How do you change a septic system line from ceramic  pipe to PVC pipe? ,"Wow, how old is that system? A lot of times with these old systems the problem is that the inlet tee (they used to be concrete, molded into the tank) deteriorates causing a grease clog at that end of the tank, so it's constantly clogging up. I'd check that out before you dig up the whole line. However if you're sure the line needs replacing, dig it up just uncovering the top of the pipe for the whole length. Once that's done you can break the clay pipe in sections and take it out while maintaining the pipe bed (so you'll be sure to have the correct fall on the new pipe). If yours is a residence replace the clay pipe with 4"" sch40 PVC. The stub-out at the house end will likely be cast iron in which case you'll need a flexible coupling (rubber with tightening bands) to make that connection. At the tank end extend the new pipe into the tank a few inches and install a tee. A septic tank always has to have a tee inside the tank with a length of pipe extending downward to within about 18"" of the bottom of the tank. This forces any grease and solids down into the tank and keeps the layer of floating scum away from the inlet. I think it goes without saying, but I'd have the tank pumped before attempting to replace the tee. New systems require a filter on the other end of the tank to keep any solids from entering the field lines.   I don't know if I'd go to that trouble with this old system, that's a matter of personal opinion. However, I've done repairs where the field lines were full of panty liners (they don't degrade), where a filter would have saved them. Good Luck"

How do I repair it? it's only about 10-12 inches wide and about 3 feet high. Any suggestions?,"I just did some repairs to some lath and plaster this morning. You need to pick off any ""loose"" pieces at the edges of your existing hole. Your 1 foot by 3 foot repair may become larger! It's tough to know when to stop. When you feel you have removed the most loose pieces, it's time to start the repair. You need to purchase some ""setting type"" joint compound. It comes in a powder that you add water to, and mix to a consistancy that is slightly thinner than peanut butter. It should'nt sag when applied to the wall. Fill the area and put some mesh tape over the edges. The joint compound that you purchase should be a 90 minute setting type. This means it will be dry within that time and you can reapply some more to finish it. I would also suggest using a regular joint compound to ""feather out"" and finish the area. It's easier to sand. This job is a little tricky. It takes alot of practice to get familiar with the tools and to get a good feel for the material. If you apply the joint compound evenly and smooth at each coat, you should have minimal sanding only after the last coat is applied.   Good luck  (If you have to remove to much plaster I would suggest screwing on a piece of 1/4 inch drywll in the area.)"

When it finally started up, the brakes were stiff and it would rumble before it finally get some gas and go.  There was also a squeaky sound as I was driving.  This same problem occurred in Flagstaff while I was up there going to school.  I figured it was the cold weather, but I'm now in southern AZ and there's no cold weather going on here.","A squeaky noise may indicate a loose fanbelt or a fanbelt encountering too much resistance.In this case the sound will be like: Whinnninnninnninnnn!!!If you have a serpentine belt (a belt that winds around engine components like a snake), you don't necessarily have to replace it. It may be just loose. Snug it up. There will be an adjusting bolt somewhere most likely near the alternator. Buy a Haynes manual for your car at an Autozone ($12.00). It will show you exactly where the bolt is if you can't find it.If you have one belt that wraps around the crankshaft pulley, the air conditioner compressor, and the alternator(a more simpler setup to the serpentine), there will be an adjusting bolt right in front of the alternator. Snug it up if the belt is loose.Does it happen when you are steering? Turn the car on and steer the wheel lock to lock. If you hear a whining sound, you need power steering fluid. Un cap the reservoir and fill it. The Haynes manual will show you where it is.Does the problem only occur when the AC is on? Switch it on and off with the engine running. It it comes and goes, and the belt is not loose, your AC compressor needs oil. Buy a can of R134a AC gas with compressor lubricant and inject it into the input port. The port looks like a tire valve at the top of one of your AC lines. Again, your Haynes manual and the directions with the R134a can will tell you the details.Good Luck! This should only cost you around $20-25 including the manual cost."

Fortunately it's easy, if a little repetitive, to get the stains out. Here's how. Steps In a spray bottle, mix up a solution of 1/2 warm water and 1/2 white vinegar. Spray the stained area with the solution. Press a dry terrycloth towel over the wet area. Remove the towel when it's soaked. Repeat until the stains are gone. Tips If you don't want to spend a whole day doing this, apply the solution whenever you happen to be driving. Just remember to remove the towel promptly and let the carpet dry out. Don't be discouraged by a deep-rooted stain. It will come out eventually. Warnings Avoid the temptation to rub the stained area.

Typically 3 bolts and the exhaust feedback tube. Disconnect the eletrical lines.Replace in reverse order.Check out:http://autorepair.about.com/library/a/1e/bl948e.htm

However, they are now denying the claim, stating that the crack was due to weather condition changes. Does anyone know anything about marbled tables (any URLs or info) and possibly where I can another professional quote(in the Seattle area)?","With a picture I could answer you're question. I have seen tables go from Italy to Canada without a hitch.  Bad manipulation from lack of knowledge is usually the cause.  But lacquered tables have now been eliminated from our market because of such problems.  Also because a marble cracked table is easily repaired, a marble lacquered table is impossible to repair. The color of the marble plays into this as well."

This is a F-150 pick-up. 1994","If I understand the question, you want to know what the problem may be when the problem IS NOT that the system is undercharged? If the system is fully charged is your compressor cycling? If not, do you have power to the compressor? The system may have enough charge but if the pressures on the high side and the low side are not right the system will not operate properly. If the high side pressure is too high there is probably a restriction and a high pressure switch will shut the compressor off to prevent more pressure from building up. How do you know it doesn't need to be charged? If a shop looked at it they probably checked the pressure (or they should have) so find out what they were. Need more info for a more specific diagnosis."

Anybody know of any good resources?This is for my parents who live 2 hours away from me (and I don't feel like driving).  I know this is a simple task, I just need some resources that I can send my parents so they can do it themselves.","I am not a mechanic, but I did change an o2 sensor on a my 92 maxima once.  What you need is to call your local dealer's parts department and ask them for the directions to change the o2 sensor from their repair manual.  They will usually fax it over to you if you have the capability or make you copies.  Otherwise you can buy the repair manual and o2 sensor from them if need be or of course a auto parts store such as Autozone usually carries both items.  I will tell you that you will need a GOOD bolt loosen-er/rust remover like WD40, and a lot of it!  The o2 sensor is on the underside of the exhaust usually towards the front around where the driver/passenger sits.  I hope this helps."

It is easy to get to.  Replacing the solenoid is easy also.  There is a sidepan on the transmission that is not hard to remove and most of the time you just cut the wires and wire in the new solenoid, I think there is a small bolt that holds the solenoid in place, but it has been a while.

2055,32676,How do you remove a torque converter from transmission on a 1982 Chevrolet 3500 truck.? ,"The torque-converter is bolted to the fly-wheel on the back of the engine and is slid in to the front pump on the transmission.  You will have to either remove the engine to get to it, or remove the transmission.  Removing the trans. is the prefered method by most.  There are 6 bell-housing bolts that must be removed that hold the engine and trans. togeteher.  There are 3 bolts that hold the torque-converter to the fly-wheel, remove them also, you will have to turn the crankshaft to allow access.  It is easiest to remove the starter to get it out of the way, along with the exhaust by unbolting it at the flange at the end of the manifold.  Then you have 2 cooling lines that screw into the trans., a driveshaft that you unbolt from the rear-differential, a dip-stick tube and the shifter linkage that unbolts from the trans. and the mount which is located at the bottom of the trans.  There is a crossmember that you have to unbolt from the frame, that is what the other end of the mount bolts to.  If you have four wheel drive you have to remove the front driveshaft and the linkage to it.  Some people also like to separate the transfer-case and the trans before removal.  There is also a speedometer cable and a few wires.  Word of advice, drain the transmission before you start.  After that the torque-convert will slide out of the front of the trans..  It looks like a big donut.  The new one will slide back on, but make sure to turn it to get it to go all the way in, there should not be enough room to get a finger between it and the transmission, and it should turn freely.  Reverse the removal and fill with fluid."

Or is it not a problem?Any advice would be helpful, for example should I take it to a prosche dealer. Would it be too expensive?","4 years... any fuel will probably have turned into varnish by now, most likely battery is bad. To start remove all mouse, bird and varmit nests. Change the oil and filter, turn crank by hand to make sure the engine isn't siezed from rust. Pull fuel line from tank and flush tank with fresh petrol. Reconnect fuel line to tank and put in several litres. Install new battery and petrol pump. Clean and gap plugs, install new plug wires. Check all electrical for chewed or frayed wires(even covered and garaged the mice get in). There may also be flat spots on the cam after sitting for so long. The rings could be rusted and break at start up. Both of the last two statements are just educated guesses. If you feel comfortable gently try starting the car by bumping the starter.

2093,135552,how do you replace a male connector on a power tool? my tool has a two mprong connector but the connector i bought has a ground is it still compatible,"yes. simply dont hook up the ground. first, make sure the tool is double insulated (look on the nameplate for a symbol of a box inside another box, or the words double insulated)your tool should have this due to the 2 coductor cable you've mentioned. cut the existing cord cap off of the tool, strip back the outer sheathing of the cable carefully not to nick the inner conductors. if u can see wires note colors, the black wire is going to go in the brass screw terminal of your new cord cap this is your ""hot wire""and the white wire is going to go under the silver screw terminal this is youre neutral wire"". the green terminal is your ground simply dont land a wire on this terminal. note you'll only be able to use this tool in a grounded 3 wire recepticale. don't worry these are a common code practice. if your cable is similar to lamp cable then look for some type of identification on the wire such as a ribbed stripe in the insulation itself or writing on a wire. this wire is your neutral wire the other is your hot. follow above instructions. also note, do not leave any extra free conductor of wire and dont strip more outer sheathing than you need. remember you want it to end up in the cord cap.good luck"

2099,36497,how to install rear brakes on 1993 mazda 929? ,"Rear brakes can be a pain, especially if they're drum brakes and not disc.  First thing to do would be to go out and get a Hayne's Manual for your car and it's year.  This book will cover the brakes specifically for your car, and will include pictures, step by step, and the reassembly.  They also make a Brake Manual that covers all kinds of brakes.  It's a little more detaild and includes even more pictures.  Both books can be found at any auto parts store and are normally only $15.  Disc brakes should require no more than a socket set and maybe some allen wrenches.  It's normally only two bolts on the caliper.  Drum brakes will require some specialized tools, but they're very inexpensive.  If you've never done it before, drum brakes work with multiple springs on the inside that have to be replaced in specific order.  You will need to give yourself some time to figure it out, and even better, a camera to take a picture of the other side (it gets old running back and forth to make sure you're doing it right since you'll be doing one wheel at a time; obviously one will still be assembled).  The books will help a lot though.Disc brakes can take as little as 15 minutes to replace, drums as much as a whole day."
2100,39571,how to build a lift kit for a 2000 chevy 4x4? ,"Your truck has IFS, independent front suspension. The most you can get from the suspension is about 1.5inch lift, by adjusting the torsion bars to max. This is not recommended because of the added torsional stress on the bars, and your ride will be rough. You can gain a couple inches doing a body lift, again not recommended due to complications with the steering angles, brake lines, cooler lines, etc... and your bumper wont line up with the body, which looks goofy.On a brighter note... you can lift the rear of the truck easily. Adding extra leafs can gain a few inches and increase the load capacity. You can use lift blocks, Max 3inch or you will get axle hop, also this must be done with correctly designed parts to be safe. Finally, you can put large springs in, which is your best bet.If you do it... Do it right. Buy a lift kit from Rancho, Skyjacker, etc. Which ever you choose, unless you are mechanically inclined, get it done professionally."
2101,130517,How do i get to a heat core on an 1989 Chevy blazer? ,"The heater core is like a mini radiator which is mounted on the firewall in front of the passenger footwell.

It's a complicated job, especially if you have A/C, since the A/C evaporator is mounted adjacent to or right in front of the heater core.

My door hit one of those little metal poles that stick out of the ground about 3.5 feet and have reflectors for night at the top of them.

2111,38325,"How do i get rid of rust coming out of the air regulator valves in my whirlpool tub? plumbers are all stumped!

What could be the problem?  the house was built in 1991 and it is the original whirlpool tub (says Dayton on the whirlpool timer on the wall). help!","I will agree with just about every body's answer.  Most pump on whirlpools are nylon impellers or bronze, which both of them should not produce rust.  If your water heater is rusting out it could be the problem, draining will only last a while.  If you happen to have galvanized pipe of a piece of black pipe in you water system this could cause rust. If you go to other fixtures in your house and get rust out of them it could be that.  It could also be from the water main it self, which is a city or if your on a well a problem at the source.  You might try to put a filter on the water lines going to the whirlpool if if is not the pump or piping on the whirlpool itself causing the rust problem."

2126,58904,"How do I prevent leakage around the bolts holding the toliet tank to the toliet bowl? I purchased a kit which contained new bolts, 4 flat washers, 4 rubber washers and 4 nuts.  From top to bottom, I placed the washers as follows:  bolt, metal washer, rubber washer, through tank, metal washer, nut, through base, rubber washer, metal washer and then nut.  I tightened the first nut to a point that I was afraid to tighten it any more in fear I would crack the tank.  I tightened the second nut until the tank fully contacted the base and would not wobble.","No offense to the previous answers but ""Don't try to re-invent THE WHEEL""   Follow prescribed instructions.   Alternating tightening of the two bolts is a good idea.   Make certain the tank was seated properly to begin with, and the nuts threaded without cross threading. The metal washers are designed to prevent damage to the rubber washers under,,,or above them. The washers,,, or at least one of them should act as a flange type thing that seats in the bolt hole and expands to fill the hole as the nut is tightened.    Having them tightened but out of balance with each other will often cause an improper seating of one or both sides.   Drain and remove the tank. Check the condition of the hardware, perhaps buying new. Check the condition of the exit hole and the seal for it. Re- seat the tank, add the bolt with the metal washer added first, then the sealing washer. Under the tank add the rubber washer, metal washer, and nut. Tighten to what seems to be a point of some resisitence, perhaps as you can see the bottom rubber washer begin to expand a bit in its compression. Refill the tank just enough to check for leaks, and if you notice any, then tighten a half or quarter turn equally on each nut until the leaking stops.   Unless the tank or its main sealing holes have been corrupted, the leaking should vanish.Rev. Steven"

Its sat for 2-3 days now and i don't know what to use that won't ruin our concrete driveway.,"OK, don't use soda or any water-spraying methods - they will just spread the oil around and make it worse.  Oil floats on water, remember? Here's what you do:  If there is liquid oil sitting on the drive, use oil absorber, cat litter, or sand (in order of effectiveness) to absorb it..  Just dump it on and sweep it around until it is absorbed, then scoop it up and dispose of it.  To get the rest, I've had luck with ""Castrol Superclean"" full strength.  Auto parts stores carry a product designed specifically to eat oil off of concrete though; I'd say that's the best bet.  If your driveway is sealed beware as some chemicals will eat the sealer right off.Good Luck!"

Are there any clever tricks that you can share with me on how to go about repairing such a damage. From the looks of it, seems like only the front exposed area is damaged.","No clever tricks here. You'll have to remove the roof covering (shingles) by pulling the nails carefully under the exposed part of the shingle. Get a nail bar for this. Remove enough shingles to expose what sheathing needs replacing plus a bit to give you ""tool room"". Cut out the bad sheathing using a circular saw set to just a tad deeper than the thickness of the sheathing. Cut out the bad stuff as squarely as you can splitting the cut on a rafter so that you have a nailing surface on each end. Replace the sheathing to match, replace the shingles putting a dab of roof cement over each nail and paint everything to match. You may need to replace underlayment and drip edge as well. Work carefully, measure twice, cut once, don't cut nails with your new saw blade, visualize what you want to do and think before you act. The hardest part will be removing and re-installing the shingles. Don't pound on exposed surfaces of the shingles. Keep everything square.Thanks to nailpounder and samhbane :)"

2144,47329,how to install drivebelt 1996 cadillac deville? ,First before you take off the belt make sure you have a belt diagram.  If you can't find it in the engine compartment then you have to draw one.  Your 15 minute job can turn into a hour or more if you don't have one.  If you dont know where the tensioner that keeps the belt tight is pull on the belt and look for a pulley that moves.  Get a wrench or rachet depending on what is there to move the pulley.  Just pry the tensioner and slide the belt off a pulley.  I would recommend you to take off the tensioner it is only one bolt.  If it squeeked when moving it replace it while you have it off.  Also look at a new one and compare the pulleys if it looks like it is seperating replace it.  Also spin the pulley.  If it makes any noise replace the pulley.  Also check all other pulleys especially idler pulleys if they make any noises or wiggle some replace them too.Now to put the belt on use you diagram and route the belt accordingly.  Leave a smooth pulley if you can for last.  Take your wrench and pry the tens. and slipe the belt on the last pulley.  Now check to make sure you belt is straight on all pulleys.  One groove off will destroy you belt in minutes.  Maybe have someone bump the engine while you look at the belt and if at 3 times all is ok then start it.  Walaa you done.Hope that helps.By the way I do like soccer.Todd

2147,66855,"How do I know when to change the thermostat or know when it isn't working?? I flushed my radiator about three times until water was clear and then refilled with half and half, coolant/distilled water. I did this because it hadn't been done since I bought the truck ('95 Ford Ranger, 107K miles) from a neighbor two years before, plus the fact that the truck's coolant temp gauge needle was going past the middle mark but not all the way into ""H."" Afterwards, it was a little better, but it still happened once in a while for long trips on the highway. Just changed the air filter w/ a K&N filter and strangely things seemed to improve, but the needle still moves a little past the middle. I don't know what else to do. So, I'm wondering about the thermostat...",If the engine takes too long to heat up then it probably is a bad thermostat. Watch the temp Gage and see if the temperature is in the proper range when the temperature gets up to the proper operating temp then the thermostat will open up letting the water circulate through the engine.You can tell when this happens as you may be able to hear the thermostat click and followed by a sudden and temporary drop in temperature as the cooler water from the radiator starts going through the engine and the warmer water from the engine goes to the radiator to be cooled by the fan also you may sense a sudden and temporary drop in engine speed when the fan kicks in .

Then either run the wire from the switch to the horn relay, or to the horn itself. Before I was to do that, I would check the horn itself, to be sure it works. Run a jumper wire from the positive battery terminal and touch it to the spot where the wire would plug into the horn. The horn should blow. If not the horn itself is bad, no wiring bypass will help. Also check the horn relay. Usually it is the horn or the relay, not the switch that goes bad."

2153,54368,"How can u build an inexpensive turbo kit? Just putting it out there, i own a 04 civic","despite what people think. alot of companies now do make custom parts for home brew turbo kits. obviously tuning companies will have reasearched the situation much more than me or you would be able too. But a generic build would require dropping of the compression ratio (low comp pistons) and a low pressure turbo would be your best bet (something like a standard unit from say a nissan 200SX S13 series - Garret T25). you will need an intercooler too just for piece of mind. The biggest issue on the whole idea would be the management and the fueling. Your best bet on that would be a honda modding site as there are plenty of people who have taken that route with the B16 and B18 engines and reached power in the region of 300+. if anyone can help you out it would be them.The biggest money eater in any conversion is the installation labour as a tuner/garage will charge a small fortune to get the parts in the car, if your competant or have people who are and can help you could build up the block out of the car yourself, fit it and then get it set up and mapped on the rollers and most defo save money."

Buy a roll of screen and a roll of the grey spline. Roll out the screen material over the frame first without cutting it. Take the spline and on one side, use the tool and push the spline and screen into the groove up the entire length, pull the opposite side tight and run the spline on that side the same way.

Tryed everything from DIY shops but they still keep coming back ,"While Citrus oils, cayenne pepper and such will keep cats out of your garden, unfortunately you have to keep applying it every time it rains.  The best thing I've found is Coco Bean Mulch.  A left over product from coco bean production, it smells like chocolate. It is very light, but when you put it down, and wet it, it forms a mat that is difficult for weeds to get through (a harmless fungus grows through it and increases the mat effect).  In addition, every cat that has ever visited my gardens since I put it down hates the smell and the texture and stay away.  I had some cats that seemed to like leaving deposits in my grass, but I crushed some of the shells, and spread the dust over the grass where it settled down and was invisible, and cats no longer even come into the garden.  It seems to work for a long time; I haven't put any new mulch down for a year.  My daughter uses it, and her cat only stays in the garden long enough to go in and out the door.Unfortunately you do have to keep dogs away from it, as they like the smell and will eat it, and in large amounts, it is poisonous to them, just like chocolate is."

I'm the world's worst mechanic, but I I just checked my automatic transmission fluid and found that it was low, but I can't figure out how to change/add fluid.  It's on a 94 Buick Skylark - GM's 3.1 L engine.","Hey if you can check the automatic transmission fluid, you're doing better than 50% of Americans.I hope you checked it while it was warm and with the engine RUNNING! (The proper way to check an automatic transmission)If it was low, you add fluid through the dipstick hole. Typically with the use of a funnel. However, be sure that you don't OVERFILL the transmission or you'll experience a slipping transmission.Most transmissions go from the dipstick ""low"" to the dipstick ""high"" in a single PINT! This is half of what they sell. Typically transmission oil is sold in QUARTS. So if you are on the low side of the dipstick, only pour 1/2 of the bottle into your transmission to raise it up to the high mark. If you are only 1/2 down the dip stick marks, only pour 1/4 of your bottle into the transmission. (etc.)To change the trans fluid is a little more intensive than a simple oil change, and I recommend taking it to a mechanic if you are not mechanically inclined."

2216,57661,how do i re move axils from a fwd car? i want to take out the trany only,"First you have to jack up the car and support it with jackstands remove the wheels and the center axle nuts (do this before removing the brake calipers so someone can hold the brake for you to get them loose). On some cars it is possible to leave the calipers and rotors onbut not all the time. Next seperate the outer tie rod and ball joint and ush down on the a arm with a large pry bar to swing the strut out of the way. Next pull the axle out of the spindle, It might have to be tapped with a hammer to break it loose. After it is out of the spindle you can try pulling the axle out of the transmission by yanking on it a couple of times but it generally wont be that easy you will have to get under the car with a pry bar and pry it loose from the tranny. Be careful not to pry against the seal in the tranny. Also transmission fluid might come pouring out of the tranny when the axle is removed so dont lay directly under it and have a drain pan ready. To remove the transmission you are probably going to have to take it out the bottom. At this stage you can remove the torque converter bolts, tranny mounts, exhaust, shift cables, wiring, speedometer cable if you have one, and bell housing bolts. Then you can soosten the subframe bols on the engine side about half way out and with a floor jack support the tranny side of the frame and remove the sub frame bolts on that side. Slowly let the subframe down about 6 inches and stop look at your motor and make sure that nothing is binding. If it looks like the transmission will slide out under the body you can then support the motor with a piece of wood running from one strut tower to the other and a strap from that piece of wood to the motor. I like to use a 4x4 for this because it is strong enough. After the motor has been supported you can let the subframe down more and pull the transmission up off of the subframe and out from under the car. Also pay special attension to the dipstick tube it might have to be removed to do this."

2219,21587,how do I start a Boiler? It is oil fed. How long do I hold in the button? ,"An oil fired boiler doesn't have a pilot flame like a gas boiler does. It fires up automatically when the thermostat calls for heat just like a gas boiler. If the burner flame fails to ignite after about a 30 second timeout period at start up, the burner motor shuts down because you don't want to be spraying oil into the combustion chamber if the flame's not lit. The red button can be pushed once (and only once) to try to restart the burner if it times out after trying to start automatically as it normally does. But usually it won't start and just ends up spraying more oil into the combustion chamber. This is a dangerous condition for the oil repairman because once he fixes the original problem which caused the timeout and failure of the burner to light, the burner may start explosively due to all the excess oil in the combustion chamber. So don't press the red button more than once, and don't hold the red button in. When the repairman arrives, tell him how many times you pressed the red button so he'll know what safety measures to take to restart the burner once it's repaired."

2233,7857,how do i set out a traditional hip roof? i need to know thw basics of setting out a traditional hipped roof with a hip on each corner of a square building,"Okay.  First of all you say that the building is ""square"".  If you are meaning that the roof is perfectly square than you've got the a true peaked hip roof. For this type of roof all you need is the hip measurement.  The mathmatics are considered rise over run.  Rise being the height of your roof and run being 1/2 the width of your roof.  First thing first.  You'll have to decide on a pitch (angle)you want your roof to be. Nprthern homes typically have steeper roofs due to snow loads while southern roofs typically have lower pitches due to higher wind loads.  Once you have your pitch decided, we'll use a 6"" over 12"" pitch in our example.  If you know that your building is 12 feet wide then 1/2 of that is 6 feet.  This is considered our run.  We will now simple multiply our run (6') by our desired pitch (which just happens to be 6. 6 x 6= 36"" or 3 feet.  What this all boils down to is that for every 1 foot of our run our pitch moves up 6 inches.  Next step is using yet more math to discover our lenght of rafters needed.  The pythagiam (excuse the spelling) is the math we will be using.  It's simply wrote as a2 x b2 = c2.  We know what ""a"" and ""b"" are.  A=36"" and B=6'or 72"". Multiply 36 x 36 and you will get 1296.  Multi 72 x 72 and you get 5187.  Add 1296 and 5184 and you get 6480.  Now let's find the square root of 6480 (Good time for a calculator). 80.49 inches.  Roughly thats 80 and 1/2 inches.  This is our rafter length for a common rafter.  For the hips will use the same equations except we will multiply our same run by the number 17 instead of 12.  Additionally the pitch for the hip will be considered 6 over 17.  which means 6 inches of rise for every 17 inches of run.  If this is all to complicated go to Lowes and buy a speed square that comes with a rafter book.  The book will tell you how to measure for your rafters and the speed square will show you the proper angle.Good Luck!!!!"

2250,85614,how do i put in a radiator? ,"You must first remove the old one.  Start by getting a drain pan.  Put it under the drain plug of the radiator and open it.  It should be a valve at the bottom that will turn with minimal pressure from a pair of pliers. Open the radiator cap to allow breathing while draining. Once drained, then you will need to remove the hoses.  Should be two, an upper and lower.  I would do the lower first.  After the hoses, you'll need to undo the two transmission lines assuming you have an automatic transmission. If it's a stick shift this part isn't necessary.  You'll likely want to ""stop up"" the ends of those lines so tranny fluid doesn't leak all over.  Eyeball your new equipment beforehand to make sure all these inlet and outlet connections are going to be the same on the old one and new one.  The overflow line from the cap area to a separate bottle will also have to be disconnected.  Next would be to locate whatever brackets and bolts that need to be removed to extricate the old radiator.                                   There should be a fan shroud or a fan assembly with shroud that you will have to figure how best to remove. depending on how your car is made, it may be easier to remove the whole fan assembly after you remove it and the radiator as one unit. When I did mine, there was one electrical connection to the fan assembly that was actually attached to the radiator itself.  I disconnected the electrical plug and removed the assembly after removing the radiator.  Much easier to get to that way.  Then you begin doing everything in reverse order to install the new one.  make sure you refill the new one with the appropriate mix of coolant and water.  Half and half is pretty common but you may want to consult your manual."

2266,131285,How do i waterproof my deck? ,"Thoroughly clean the deck using a pressure washer or stiff bristle brush, allow to dry. Unlike the other poster, I disagree about using a sprayer to apply the sealer. Using a sprayer causes A LOT of waste. What might have taken 2 gallons of sealer, will take 8 gallons with a sprayer. And it causes puddles on the deck surface and looks awful. I suggest using a 9"" medium nap paint roller for the deck surface and a 3"" medium nap roller for the ballusters and railings."

2269,103291,How do i repair my car brakes? ,"Easy. Change pads? Disc or rotor. First remove the tire/rim. Sometimes they are stuck on so have a deadblow hammer handy.On rotor brakes the calipers must be removed from the rotors. The pads should pop right out. You may need a C-clamp to push the caliper piston in, so have one of those handy too. Replace the pads just as you found the others.For drum brakes, the drum head must be removed. I have found drum brakes easier to change once you have access to the pads.The only other thing to be done besides changing lines if you have a leak, is to bleed the brakes. You need two people for this.One person behind the wheel, and the person at the wheel well releases the nipple on the caliper. Person at wheel pushes brake to floor. You do this several times until you have good brake pressure. Don't forget to retighten the bleeder nipple you loosened. This gets rid of water and air in the lines.Make sure you have plenty of brake fluid in the resevoir.Not too sure what you meant by repair them.....if this doesn't cover it maybe you can be more specific. If you feel this is over your head, just take it to a mechanic. Changing the brake pads or getting brake service done isn't too expensive."
2270,61720,how can i get horsepower gains in stock 04 silverado 2WD? and better throttle response? just looking for little things that i can tweek to get better results,"You can throw on a new intake and some new pipes out the back.  Improved air flow in and out of the engine will always do the trick.  An aftermarket computer programmer will also take care of the fuel curve, but while it adds more horsepower, you will lose a mile or two per gallon.  They're incredibly easy to use anymore...they just plug into your diagnostic port, which is normally under the dashboard.  If you want even more, you can add a larger bore throttle body.  Again, this will require a bit more fuel so that the ngine doesn't lean out, but your programmer should take that into account and will take care of that.  You could go on forever with upgrades and aftermarket stuff, but they're typically the cheapest and best start.  Check out http://www.summitracing.com/.  you should get yourself one of their catalogs.  I'm almost positive they're free, and it's the best bathroom reading ever printed.  You'll spend $10000 in your mind before you even finish the engine section."

2275,132906,how can i figure out what size of a tool (& what tool) 2 tighten up the bolts on my tires? it is a 91 saturn.. ,"If you go to any autoparts store like AutoZone, they will do it for you.  Otherwise just purchase a Cross Iron, it has four of the most common tire bolt (called lug nuts) sizes.  However, they take up a lot of space and if your in a saturn you don't have an overwhelming amount of space to give, so go to AutoZone and have them find the right tire iron (it's a small L-shape).  If they don't have it just go to another place.Furthermore you might want to get a ""cheat-bar"" too.  It's just a hollow metal tube that goes over your tire iron and extends the length of it, therefore it give you more leverage incase your lug nutz are really tight.  I'm a strong guy and I still need one once in a while and it doens't take up much space if you put it side by side with your tire iron.Oh yeah, and like the other guys said, unless you lost yours, you should have one that came with the car."
2276,84495,How do you clean a deck with a powerwasher? What products should I use to remove and stain/seal the deck? I have a power washer.  I would like to know what products work well to remove old stain.  I would like to know if I should stain or seal and what's the difference.,"As for how to powerwash....Just use your powerwasher on the deck. The high-powered stream should remove all the old stain and dirt that has been acummulating on it. You'll notice the difference immediately once you start.The difference between staining a deck and sealing it is simple. Staining refers to changing the appearance, or color, of the wood. You can use a darker stain to have the deck look like cherry wood or go with a lighter stain to have it look like oak, or cedar. Stain isn't necessary, it just helps to improve the look of the deck.Sealing involves puting a chemical coating on the wood to protect it from the elements, specifically water and moisture. It's a very important part of the upkeep for a deck.As far as what you should do with your deck? That's for you to decide. I would think the sealing is mandatory, but the staining is optional. You'll have to decide if you like the way the deck currently looks, or if you would like to change the wood's finish."

2292,629,how do you repolace brakes on a 1996 honda sedan v6? ,"For instructions on line go to www.autozone.com. It has info for the 1994. I believe they will work for the 1996If equipped with an air bag, disconnect the negative battery cable and properly disable the Supplemental Restraint System (SRS), as detailed in Chassis Electrical . Loosen the lug nuts, then raise and support the vehicle safely. Remove the wheel. As required, separate the brake hose clamp from the strut or knuckle by removing the retaining bolts. Remove the lower caliper retaining bolt and pivot the caliper upward, off the pads. Clean the caliper thoroughly; remove any rust from the lip of the disc or rotor. Check the brake rotor for grooves or cracks. If any heavy scoring is present, the rotor must be replaced. Install the pad retainers. Apply a brake-quiet compound (available at most auto parts strores) to both surfaces of the shims and the back of the disc brake pads. Do not get the compound on the braking surface of the pad. Install the pads and shims. The pad with the wear indicator goes in the inboard position. Push in the caliper piston so the caliper will fit over the pads. This is most easily accomplished with a large C-clamp. As the piston is forced back into the caliper, fluid will be forced back into the master cylinder reservoir. It may be necessary to siphon some fluid out to prevent overflowing. Pivot the caliper down into position and tighten the mounting bolt to 33 ft. lbs. (45 Nm). Connect the brake hose to the strut or knuckle, if removed. Install the wheel and lower the vehicle to the ground. Check the master cylinder and add fluid as required, then install the master cylinder cover. Depress the brake pedal several times and make sure that the movement feels normal. The first brake pedal application may result in a very ""long"" pedal due to the pistons being retracted. Always make several brake applications before starting the vehicle. Bleeding is not usually necessary after pad replacement. Braking should be moderate for the first 5 miles or so until the new pads seat correctly. The new pads will bed best if put through several moderate heating and cooling cycles. Avoid hard braking until the brakes have experienced several long, slow stops with time to cool in between. Taking the time to properly bed the brakes will yield quieter operation, more efficient stopping and contribute to extended brake life. If equipped, enable the SRS system and connect the negative battery cable"

Usually just to the left (or right) of the flush handle.  This causes an ongoing displacement of water  that is never used.  You save the ziplock full of water on every flush.

2315,64377,How do you recharge a window air conditionors freon? My window units are not producing cold air where do i put the freon in and where do I buy it,"I agree. Almost every widow unit made doesn't have any refrigerant taps to add refrigerant. Most causes of window units not working are usually dirty coils. Take the window unit out and take it apart and clean the condenser (outside) coil and the evaporator (inside) coil with a garden hose and sprayer. Wash the coils out the opposite way the airflow goes through the coil. Let it dry out good and also clean and/or replace the filter. Put the unit back in the widow and try it. 9 times out of 10 that usually fixes it. Dirty coils make the compressor and motor works  lot harder, and therefore they get hotter the harder they work.

2319,85814,How do you get Thompson's waterseal off of hardiplank siding without damaging the siding? ,"Thompson Water Seal is an oil based product.  The oil in the product causes water to bead up on the surface and tends to prevent the absorption of water.  Naturally, this oil needs to be refreshed fairly often in order to maintain protection.I would mix up a bucket of water and car wash soap and scrub the affected areas with a fairly soft bristled brush.  The soap will cause the oil in the water seal to break down after which it can be rinsed off.  Be sure and rinse thoroughly and rescrub if necessary.  This will give you a huge head start in getting rid of the Thompson's Water Seal.  Keep in mind that this brand of water seal loses its' effectiveness after as little as 6 months in a wet climate.I would also recommend using a stain blocking primer prior to painting your siding with a finish color.Good luck with your project."

2321,62923,How do i gut plaster walls? ,wear a dust mask first. and get your self a lot of strong garbage bags. I would start by hitting the wall with a crowbar to break the plaster and (wearing gloves) start to break off the plaster with your hands and use the crobar if you need to. I would remove all the plaster first then the lath or wooden strips. this process will just make the clean up a little easier to mannage. you can also dampen the walls with water to limit the dust. If you do it in a methodical mannner it wont be such a bitch to clean up. and when you start pulling of the lath as you are removing it lay them in piles so it will be easier to bundle up for removal. Good luck

At first i thought it was coming from the bell housing on the transmission because that is where it seems to be the loudest when i climbed under the car and listened for it but i just dont know. Do torque converters knock? I was just wondering in case it is the engine how to go about stopping it. The engine was rebuilt back in Sept. 05 by the previous owner and he claimes it has not been driven that much until i bought it last month. Any suggestions,"Sounds like a bad rod bearing, but without hearing the noise myself, I can not be sure. If the noise is from the bottom of the motor, it is not a torque converter, but a bearing. On a new rebuild, if the engine is not broken in correctly, the bearings will fail!Depending on the engine and the amount of damage, you may be able to have the bearings replaced, ot you may need to have the crankshaft machined. Either way you are looking a a rather expensive repair."

If you're talking about a newer model, I hate to say it man, but as far as I know, you may be Sh!t outta luck.  I'd say your best bet would be to look for gears for the rear end, a shift kit for the transmission, air intake, exhaust or a computer chip.

Especially the oil change every 3000 miles. My toyota van has 242,000 miles on it, and my last one had 250k. Both even had head gasket leaks for over 50k miles! Oil changes, my friend, oil changes.Inline engines last longer in general than V or opposed cylinders, because they have more main bearings than cylinders. More cylinders last longer than less in general, because the wear and load is spread between more cylinders, so they wear slower.I had a 1970 Maverick with an inline 6 cylinder and a 1 bbl carb with automatic transmission. It would pretty much never die, because short of running out of one of the fluids, or forgetting to change one on time, you could never blow the motor even if you floored it everywhere you went. 1 barrel can't dump in enough gas to make it wind up harder than 7 main crank bearings could handle. That was the first car I ever got over 200,000 miles.

I plan on using a clear finish, so any type of oil may stain or darken the natural wood look.Any help is greatly appreciated!","Oil it.  I would not put a clear finish on it.  Get a good quality furniture oil for light wood, it should be about the color of honey.  Clean off the dust with compressed air.  Oil it and let it soak in for a month.  Use wooden pegs and drilling to repair cracks.  OK no oil, I just love the natural finish though.No oil:  Change your work schedule and work in the wettest time of the year for your area after your trunk has had a chance to soak up some humidity.  Don't wet it  (although a wash might not hurt) unless you plan on sanding it.  Just make sure it's evenly exposed. prop it up in the air if necessary.  Hang up the wash nearby, etc.  Try using larger clamps and protect your trunk with pieces of scrap wood between it and the clamps.   Work slowly."

Flooding, reoccurring moisture, etc.   Dehumidifiers can slow it.   I recently replaced all the drywall in an 11,000 sq. ft. building due to damage and black mold growth from flooding. The organization attempted bleach and Kilz without success.  In this case I cut the drywall 2 inches above the floor line and added moulding to the floor. The flooding may still reoccur, but the water will not attack the drywall.   In the case of drywall and paint, the mold attacks the paper on the drywall and leaches through the paint. It does not attack the plaster substance of the drywall, but that is of little consolation in a case as I mentioned.Rev. Steven"

2429,137982,How do you know if your alignment is messed up? How often do you need to get that looked at?,"Your car can pull left or right for a number of reasons, one of which is poor alignment. Unless you hit something or your car has a buttload of miles on it or you played Ricky Racer and tampered with the springs, chances are your alignment is fine. Worn or out-of-balance tires often play havoc with your steering. They will make it do all kinds of funny things, like pull to one side, or shake the steering wheel, or make your car very hard to steer, especially at low speed. The two expendable things in the suspension system of your car are tires and shocks (or struts). More driving, more wear. So get them checked first if you are having handling or tire wear issues. Poor alignment will make your tires wear unevenly, as will worn shocks or struts. If you wreck your car or hit the curb hard enough, your alignment can get messed up. Over time, rubber components in the suspension go bad, causing misalignment. I wouldn't get it checked more than once every couple of years. In fact, I never have had it checked on any of my cars. Never had problems, either."

2444,86221,"How to wire a 250v 50a male plug? This is for an arc welder.  My female receptacle is a 50 amp 3 blade receptacle.  The ground is U shaped.  The other two have a long blade and a short blade.  I bought a male plug to fit it.  My new welder has 4 wires.  Green is ground, I know that.  A blue wire is tied off (per the welders instructions).  That leaves a brown L1 wire and a black L2 wire, they are both hot.My question is...which of the remaining two straight prongs on the plug are hot?  Is it the tall blade (1/2""), short blade (5/16""), or both?  Which blades should the brown and black wire go to?  The welders instructions show nothing connected to a neutral wire.  The plugs instructions just show the green wire going to the ground, and 2 other wires going to the other two blades.","Assuming you are following the welder's instructions, you only need a 3 wire plug (2 hot plus ground) and that is what you have.  The 50A 250V plug you have is a 6-50P in the chart at http://www.leviton.com/sections/techsupp/nema.htm right?

2452,114420,"How do i test  a starter and alternator in a 1992 pontiac grand am? car turns over, but wont start","Debra, the starter must be uninstalled manually.After the starter is in your hands set it down on a surface or table near the vehicles battery.You will need a pair of jumper cables which you will attach to the battery terminals.You must then very carefully touch the cable terminal extensions from the battery to the 'bendix' of the starter (this is the mechanism that sends the gears into the starter motor and also contacts with the 'flywheel') and the other cable to the body or external armature of the starter.The bendix should kick in and the starter should whirl around.If the bendix does not engage the problem may be in the terminal relays. If the starter is engaged by the bendix but refuses to whir, then you may have a problem with the starter shaft bushings. If the bushings are worn out this will allow the body of the rotor to make contact with the starter casing which creates an electrical feed that makes the starter shaft rotate and thusly turn over the flywheel which in turn turns over the engine. Bushings are easy to replace and if you can learn how to do this you will save a bundle.As for the alternator problem you may have a good read out on your battery charging gauge if the alternator is working. Another way to find out whether the alternator is putting out energy is to turn your cars' engine on and then disconnecting one of the battery terminals. If the engine dies out you may have a bad alternator. Another method is by using an electronic meter to measure the alternators output. And by the way, alternators also fall victim to worn bushings that can be replaced by the owner of the car.  Have a good one,  Jose"

When you pump it up the car should stall if the egr valve is fully functioning. If the idle doesn't change either the egr valve is stuck closed or the egr passages are so clogged with carbon no air can get through. If you have a scan tool and can get a DPFE voltage reading you should hook up the vaccuum pump to the egr valve and pump it while watching the DPFE voltage reading. If the idle changes but the DPFE sensor voltage reading does not change you know it is the sensor. Those sensors often go bad and so do the rubber hoses that are attached to them."

2458,83280,How do you change the spark plugs on a 2000 musytang 3.8!? ,Well there is no special thing to do on your car versus any other car.  Just take off a plug wire buy twisting the wire as you pull so you won't damage the wire.  Put a socket on the plug and unscrew it.  Make sure you gap it to 52-56 on the plug.  Put some grey anti-seize on the treads and screw them in to 15Nm or about as tight as a oil drain plug.  Also put some dielectical grease on the boots so the boots won't be so hard to remove next time and moisture stays out.  Then go on to the next one.  Just do them one at a time so you don't cross any wires and make sure they don't touch the exhaust.  Keep the wires from touching each other if you can so any spark doesn't just to another wire.  That's all there is to it.Also Jeep Freak has a good point on screwing them in.  The first guy is thinking of a newer mustang.  Yours is different it is like most all other old school cars.

PLEASE HELP! thanks",If there are no screws (but I'm sure there are at least a couple) then the only thing holding the door panel on are a series of plastic pieces that snap into holes in the metal door panel. Make sure you look in the door handle recesses and if the vehicle has power windows you may have to pop out the switch panel cause they hide screws in these locations pretty often. Ford hides their screws in hidden locations. Start someplace on the door and get under the plastic outer panel. Using a light look inside the door and find one of these plastic pieces and pry up on it. It will pop out without too much trouble. Work your way around the door. Once they are loose then bump the door panel from the bottom to get it out of the channel it's resting in at the top of the door.

Have you changed anything on you car? Wheel size, final drive ratio, etc? Those might affect the accuracy of your speedometer. Other than the already suggested ways of timing yourself using a 1 mile road marker, you can also have a friend pace you in his car and tell you his speedometer reading or you could borrow a friend's GPS unit and check your speed on that. If you're off by more than 5%, it's advisable to have your speedometer adjusted to the proper speed by a professional as an incorrect speed reading will have adverse effects on certain safety features such as ABS and proper airbag deployment."

The torque converter is bolted to the flex-plate.  If you move to the front of the flex-plate and inspect it you should see some nuts around the outside of the plate.  These nuts hold the torque converter.  As you remove the nuts you will have to lever the flex plate around to bring each successive nut down to the 6 o'clock position for removal.  After all the nuts are removed the converter will fall out.  A piece of rope or a strong wire is a good idea to hold it in place while you remove the nuts.I check my mail at least twice a day.

I loss power in my bedroom and suspect a arc fault problem ,"the most common AFCI devices sre installed in the circuit breaker box. just like the standard circuit breaker. check the switch on the AFCI to see if it is tripped. If it is then turn it off then turn it back on it should work.If you have a AFCI receptacle, which is a outlet, in the room (it will be the one that is way different than the others) You may have to get a AFCI/GFCI combination tester from a hardware store. If it has a reset button on it, press the button and test it. If it does not work press the test button then press the reset button again if it still does not work and the circuit breaker has not been tripped then you may have to replace the AFCI receptacle. You can get those at a hardware store as well. My advise is to replace the old one with the same kind.National Electrical Code bookArticle 210.12 (A)~An Arc-fault circuit interrupter is a device intended to provide protection from the effects of ARC FAULTS by recongnizing characteristics unique to arching and by functioning to de-energize the circuit when an arc fault is detected.

2505,71080,"how do you repair sweaky wooden floors? i have hard wood floors that sweak througout the house, is thier something i can do to stop it without removing the entire floor.","If you have a basement, or a crawl-space, you can drill screws from underneath (being careful not to use too long of a screw) through your subfloor to prevent the floorboard from moving.  This is a good cure, but, should only be used as a last resort because things can go wrong in a hurry if not done right.  Make sure you can determine how thick the plywood/subfloor under your hardwood is, and the hardwood itself, and use a considerably shorter screw then the total thickness.  You do NOT have to go into the hardwood, simply up to it so it does not move anymore.  You may have to use several screws for each spot. Have somebody up above making it squeak, it makes it alot easier to find and fix the spots.  Hope this helps, it's worked for me.  Good luck."

2523,136617,how do you get mildew off a concrete walkway? ,"I have faced the same problem.  Rent or buy a pressure washer.  It will quickly remove the mildew and dirt build up.  You will be amazed at how good your concrete walks will look.  The only problem is that the mildew will return over time.  Of course you cannot change the climate in which you live, but you can take some steps to minimize the reoccurance.  Mildew likes damp and shady areas that are not subject to constant drying winds.  Trimming trees and shrubs to expose the walks to sunlight will help.  Correcting drainage problems will also help.  If none of these options are available, consider the purchase of a pressure washer.  An electric homeowners model can be had for under $150.00.  You can then keep the mildew at bay as needed.With all due respect to the other people who have answered this question, bleach is not a good solution.  It is messy, smells bad, and is harmful to your landscaping.  It is also a temporary fix since rain water simply rinses it away over time.  It can also stain your concrete if applied too strong.Good luck with your mildew problem."

Especially if you smoke; you may have to clean the face of the mirror.Make sure that the mirror is firmly plugged in a small plug, usually at the base of the mirror.Donelly, Gentex and Mito manufacture most of these mirrors."

2536,65727,"How do you determine if slime bacteria is originating in your well or in your home pipes? I had an existing well with a log cabin and never had a problem.  I built a new house (used the same well during this process with an outbuilding and also never had a problem), but after moving in to the new house we get the rotten-egg smell in our water.","Actually, one gallon will not do much for your well.What you do, is add a gallon to your well, and wait 15 minutes.  Run your pump, until you take out all the water in your water holding tank, and replace it with the water in the well.Take a regular chlorine testing kit for a pool, and test your water, to see if it has any residual of chlorine.If you dont have any, then put another gallon down the well, and repeat this process...When you have a 1.0 mg/l residual after 15 minutes, then run your water holding tank out again, and test after 30 minutes.  (Also, open all the spigots in the house, and let the chlorinated water flow out of each of them, so that the chlorine will kill any bacteria in there as well.I estimate you will probably use 3-5 or more gallon or chlorine for your well, maybe more, maybe less, it depends on how much water you have in the well.Now, if you have a reading of 2.5 mg/l or less, IT IS SAFE TO DRINK!!My City, the City of Steubenville, Ohio, keeps a 2.5 mg/. residual of chlorine in our city water at ALL TIMES!!  (Aint it something, that 2.0 mg/l will kill fish, but we have more chlorine in our water than that!! :)...So, do not be alarmed if you do end up with a high cl2 (chlorox or chlorine) reading.Like I say, I would run it through all the lines in your house, and those outside your house, to kill all bacteria in the lines also.Also, chlorox only has 4% of chlorine by volume so, it acuatlly isnt that powerful as the two ton cylinders I was used to moving around that was straight chlorine! And that we use for the Water Filtration Plant--> Water Treatment Plant.How do I know this?I am a Ohio Class III Waste Water Plant Operator with 27 years experience, and I recently retired from the City of Steubenville.

2540,50665,How to prevent fungus growing on a damp wall? ,"The Others answers do contain some good advice.1. Unless you like fighting a continuous battle, you need to correct the cause of the damp wall. [inspect the plumbing inside for leaks ( in some areas of the country copper pipes erode from the chemistry of the water), look at the gutters, possible high ground-water, poor surface drainage outside the house (which is what I'd bet on) , or more remotely a broken water line outside]2. Bleach will kill an active fungus, but bleach evaporates and does not offer a long lasting deterrent.3. Positive Air circulation will discourage mold and fungus, will aid in drying the wall, but may be tough for some basements, and fresh air is just not practical in the colder months.4. DO NOT PAINT the wall until you have solved the moisture problem. The paint will not adhere for very long to any surface that is continuously or periodically wet.5. Dehumidification is the most common solution, but a dehumidifier is nothing more than an air conditioner with all the parts running inside. It consumes energy, and is not a good long term solution. You will always have to remember to empty the water [unless you have a pump instsalled to run the water to the utility sink or outside as some AC systems have].6. A safe chemical that will kill and prevent mold and fungus, (besides killing chewing insects such as termites) is Disodium Octaborate Tetrahydrate (NA2 B8 O13 - 4H20).  It comes in a powder form, and has no noxious fumes, but is not recommended for applications where there is running water (situations that would wash the material away). This material will not evaporate, or deteriorate. One supplier is Nisus Corp., their product is called Timbor.--- All long term solutions point to solving the water problem ---"

2560,27802,how do i install a tachometer on a 1995 geo prism? ,"I don't know your specific vehicle, but most cars have screws that hold the instrument panel on. Find the ones that go over your instrument panel, and remove them; they may be covered by plastic molding, so be aggresive when looking for them. Remove the dash, or applicable parts, that would hold the instrument cluster in. If you're replacing the whole tach, them reach behind, and unplug all the wires that plug into it. Can be tricky, as some are held in place by the inlet they plug into. Then pull the whole instrument cluster out by working it around the steering wheel. Now, like I said, I don't know your specific vehicle, so if your tach is stand alone, then just take the tach out. However, if it's like the ones I take out, you're gonna have to take the whole instrument cluster out, find what's failing on your tach, and replace it with parts from a good tach. When I did it, it was a circuit card that I had to replace. I know that was very vague, but I hope it helped somewhat. ps The instrument panel is the part with the tach, speedomoter, fuel gauge, and all the lights.....usually."

2563,99728,how to i rid a house from mold inside? ,"GENERAL CLEAN-UP PROCEDURES Identify and correct the moisture source Clean, disinfect, and dry the moldy area Bag and dispose any material that has moldy residues, such as rags, paper, leaves, or debris. What can I save? What should I toss? Substances that are porous and can trap molds, such as paper, rags, wallboard, and rotten wood should be decontaminated and thrown out. Harder materials such as glass, plastic, or metal can be kept after they are cleaned and disinfected. Ultimately, it is critical to remove the source of moisture first, before beginning remedial action, since mold growth will return shortly if an effected area becomes re-wetted. Removal of Moldy Materials After fixing the moisture source and removing excess moisture, the cleanup can begin: Wear gloves when handling moldy materials Remove porous materials (examples: ceiling tiles, sheetrock, carpeting, wood products) Carpeting can be a difficult problem -- drying does not remove the dead spores. If there is heavy mold, disposal of the carpet should be considered Bag and discard the moldy substances Allow the area to dry 2 or 3 days If flooded, remove all sheetrock to at least 12 inches above the high water mark. Visually inspect the wall interior and remove any other intrusive molds. (This step may have to be carried out by a licensed contractor). CAUTION: Spores are easily released when moldy material is dried out. Soap Cleanup Before disinfecting contaminated areas, clean the areas to remove as much of the mold (and food it is growing on) as possible. Wear gloves when doing this cleanup Use a non-ammonia soap or detergent, or a commercial cleaner, in hot water, and scrub the entire area affected by the mold Use a stiff brush or cleaning pad on block walls or uneven surfaces Rinse clean with water. A wet/dry vacuum is handy for this. Disinfect Surfaces Wear gloves when using disinfectants After thorough cleaning and rinsing, disinfect the area with a solution of 10% household bleach (e.g., 1½ cup bleach per gallon of water). Using bleach straight from the bottle will not be more effective Never mix bleach with Ammonia - the fumes are toxic For spraying exterior large areas, a garden hose and nozzle can be used When disinfecting a large structure, make sure the entire surface is wetted (floors, joists, and posts) Avoid excessive amounts of runoff or standing bleach Let disinfecting areas dry naturally overnight -- this extended time is important to kill all the mold. CAUTION: Bleach fumes can irritate the eyes, nose, and throat, and damage clothing and shoes. Make sure the working area is ventilated well. Can cleaning up mold be hazardous to my health? Yes. Exposure to mold can occur during the cleaning stage. Mold counts are typically 10 to 1000 times higher than background levels during the cleaning of mold damaged materials. Take steps to protect your health during cleanup: When handling or cleaning moldy materials, consider using a mask or respirator to protect you from breathing airborne spores. Respirators can be purchased from hardware stores; select one for particle removal (sometimes referred to as a N95 or TC-21C particulate respirator). Respirators are not as effective removing bleach fumes, so minimize your exposure when using bleach or other disinfectants. Wear protective clothing that is easily cleaned or discarded Use rubber gloves Try cleaning a small test patch of mold first. If you feel that this adversely affected your health, you should consider paying a licensed contractor or professional to carry out the work Ask family members or bystanders to leave areas when being cleaned. Work over short time spans and rest in a fresh air location. Air your house out well during after the work CAUTION: Never use a gasoline engine indoors (e.g. pressure washer, generator) -- you could expose yourself and your family to carbon monoxide.

2569,32076,how do you fix home airconditioning unit? AC unit not blowing out cool air anymore,"First, check and make sure the Breakers are on.Now, if its on, and not blowing cold air, check your furnace plenum, and see if it has frost on it. If it does, then your A/C is low on freon and you need to get it charged.Now, if you dont see frost, it could be your filters are plugged.  Take them out and replace thesm.Or, if you have an electronic air cleaner, wash the filters out.Now, if after all that, you still have no air, then your coil is probably plugged inside the furnace, and you need to go to the A/C place and get a can of cleaner. Then you spray the coil and it will clean the dirt and crud that is caked on.  (You must dissasemble the plenum enough to get to the coil, there should be screws holding it together so you can get to it).Try these and it should get that thing working... If your low on freon, then you have to call the service man to come and fill it, (you have a small leak some place and you may want to pay him extra to do the test to find it), also, if you have the plenum off, you can see the frost and ice on the coils, that tells you its low.Now, for a ""quick fix"" (if you REALLY need it for a while), put your furnace on!! Put the temperature up to the highest setting to get the flames to kick on. It will thaw the ice in a few minutes and then you can run your A/C until the unit ices up again...This is only a ""temperary"" measure and you will need to get the unit serviced...I wish you well...Jesse"

Use them all the time when playing baseball and soccer. I use it when I am working outside. It really works. The yellow jackets just veer around you. 1. All this time you've just been putting Bounce in the dryer! It will chase ants away when you lay a sheet near them. It also repels mice. 2. Spread sheets around foundation areas, or in trailers, or cars that are sitting and it keeps mice from entering your vehicle. 3. It takes the odor out of books and photo albums that don't get opened too often. 4. It repels mosquitoes. Tie a sheet of Bounce through a belt loop when outdoors during mosquito season. 5. Eliminate static electricity from your television (or computer) screen. 6. Since Bounce is designed to help eliminate static cling, wipe your television screen with a used sheet of Bounce to keep dust from resettling. 7. Dissolve soap scum from shower doors. Clean with a sheet of Bounce. 8. To freshen the air in your home - Place an individual sheet of Bounce in a drawer or hang in the closet. 9. Put Bounce sheet in vacuum cleaner. 10. Prevent thread from tangling. Run a threaded needle through a sheet of Bounce before beginning to sew. 11. Prevent musty suitcases. Place an individual sheet of Bounce inside empty luggage before storing. 12. To freshen the air in your car - Place a sheet of Bounce under the front seat. 13. Clean baked-on foods from a cooking pan. Put a sheet in a pan, fill with water, let sit overnight, and sponge clean. The anti-static agent apparently weakens the bond between the food and the pan. 14. Eliminate odors in wastebaskets. Place a sheet of Bounce at the bottom of the wastebasket. 15. Collect cat hair. Rubbing the area with a sheet of Bounce will magnetically attract all the loose hairs. 16. Eliminate static electricity from Venetian blinds. Wipe the blinds with a sheet of Bounce to prevent dust from resettling. 17. Wipe up sawdust from drilling or sand papering. A used sheet of Bounce will collect sawdust like a tack cloth. 18. Eliminate odors in dirty laundry. Place an individual sheet of Bounce at the bottom of a laundry bag or hamper. 19. Deodorize shoes or sneakers. Place a sheet of Bounce in your shoes or sneakers overnight. 20. Golfers put a Bounce sheet in their back pocket to keep the bees away. 21.

I am also having problems setting the timing.  I can't find the 0 mark on the harmonic ballancer.  I would also like some kind of general information about qaudrajets in general.  Thanks.","Before any adjusting of the carb you must correct your timing by using a timing light. Crawl under the car with the car in park and the hot wire off the ignition, and have friend bump the ignition. With a flash light you should be able to see a groove on the harmonic balancer. Take a piece of soap stone or chalk and define this groove. With this done reconnect the hot wire to the distributor. Hook the timing light up to the battery and to the no. 1 plug wire. Now you are ready to check your timing. with the car running remove the vacuum advance line to the distributor and adjust the timing by turning the distributor to bring the timing mark to 8-14 degrees BTDC (Before Top Dead Center) this should get you in the ballpark for carb adjustment.There is not that much adjustments that can be made to a Q-Jet. The only one are the air and fuel mixture screws at the front of the carb. This takes allot of trial and error before you get good at this. If you turn the screws till you have your best idle you should be fine. That's what I do. don't forget to hook your vacuum advance line back up before making carb adjustments."

2607,103965,How do you repair a leak in galvanized pipe under the sink? There is a little hole in the pipe and it is leaking under my sink.,Get a pencil and sharpen it to a five point. Pencils now are made out of graphite so no worries of lead poisoning. Stick the pencil tip in the hole as far as it will go and take a saw blade and cut it off. This will stop the water from dripping as the wood will swell. Next go buy some jbweld metal epoxy at a hardware store and follow the directions to mix it make sure the pipe is dry and coat the pipe with the jbweld and allow it to dry for a couple of days and you should be set. Galvanized pipe is not the right pipe for under a sink but you got what you got so you have to deal with it.

Avoid parking beneath them if you have a choice!While engaging a professional detailer or body shop is preferable, there are a few things you can do yourself.- Try a mild solvent, such as Kerosene. This is the primary ingredient in most commercially available bug and tar removers. - Dab some onto a clean cotton or terry rag, and rub the paint gently. Do not rub hard or you run the risk of scratching the paint.- Our professional uses a citrus degreaser and a piece of soft modeling clay. He applies a small amount of degreaser onto the sap, and rubs gently in circles using the modeling clay until the sap spot is gone. - Once the sap is removed from the finish it is important to wash the vehicle and re-wax to restore the glossy shine. If there are any fine scratches, try removing them using a rubbing compound before you wax."

2612,17144,how do you get rid of a musty odor in your car if it has been wet inside before? ,"95% of trapped odors are in your carpet, most likely from mildew. To get rid of the odor, you first have to get rid of its source. Go to your local auto supply store (auto zone, advance, O' Reilly, NAPA, etc) and buy some upholstery/carpet shampoo. Look for a kind that also disinfects if available. First vacuum the carpet. Then test the shampoo in a small inconspicuous area to make sure it is color safe. Work the shampoo in really well, blot it dry with a clean cloth, and then let it dry thoroughly. Then vacuum the carpet and upholstery again. you may need to do this a couple of times depending o the severity of the mildew so don't get frustrated. After you're done give the carpet a couple of squirts of your favorite cologne, or air freshener, for a finishing touch. Then you'll be good to go. Hope this helps."

2615,103826,How can I tell if my fuel pump is working and if that is the cause of my car not starting? It's a 1992 Camry ,"Locate the fuel line to the intake or fuel rail to the injectors. Disconnect the hose, and put a container below it to catch any fuel. Have a buddy or family member turn the key, but not enough to start the engine to rotate. If fuel is not flowing it could be the pump or fuel pump relay or fuel pump fuse. If fuel is flowing, it could be the ignition system. Like plugs, wires, distributor. Just do a process of elimination and try to save yourself some money. If you check the fusees or relays and they are good. The pump is more than likely in the fuel tank and will need to be dropped to replace. Just remember, use a quality part and do it right and do it once. Don't settle for the cheapest. The cheapest will leave you stranded on the side of the road in the rain or worse. Far from home with no money.  IF you are unsure about anything. Purchase a manual from your nearest auto parts store and read it! GOOD LUCK!"

Using the patch as a template, place it over the hole and trace. Cut out using the tracing as your guide at the same bevel as the patch. Insert a backer board with construction adhesive applied to the ends. Hold the backer board firmly in place and screw drywall screws through the drywall into the board, at least 1 inch away from the edge of the hole. Repeat if using two backer boards. Place the new piece of drywall in the hole and fasten it to the backer board(s) with screws. Smooth compound around the edges of the patch on the wall. Smooth it out and put drywall tape over all joints with the joint knife. At the end of each joint, press the edge of the knife blade in firmly and use as a straightedge to tear off the tape. Sand when dry.Using a wide joint knife, spread a smooth, thin layer of joint compound over the repaired area or over all joints of the new patch.

I need to replace a washer on the bathtub faucet and I can't find a way to do that without turning off the water to the whole house.","There are two ways: at the city water meter, you need a ""meter key"" wrench.

Either of those cost six or seven dollars at the hardware store. The easier way is to locate the place inside the house (probably the basement or crawl space where the water pipe comes in. There's usually a valve there you can just turn off with your hand. A final thought is that the water lines leading to the bath tub probably have valves along the way somewhere.

Are the crawl space openings good enough or do I need to do something more?","We went through the moisture problem and crawlspace vent issue years ago.  We found that there were conflicting opinions about vents, moisture barriers, sump pumps and proper ventilation. We were enlightened when we researched more.We found each home can have its own solutions but the moisture levels in the wood tell you much.  When moisture levels are over 20%, decay is inevitable but not rotting yet.  Moisture levels over 28% means the wood decay fungi is active (it feeds on the starch of your wood to rot it) and there is likely visible damage already.  Fungi and mold do not grow or become active if the levels are lower.  Generally, air flow keeps moisture levels down.Here is a Clemson University PDF home maintenance publication about moisture levels and control at :http://virtual.clemson.edu/groups/psapublishing/PAGES/FYD/HL255.pdf  Also NC State has one at http://www.ces.ncsu.edu/depts/fcs/housing/pubs/fcs486.htmlThis is good too.

They open and close automatically with the temperature differences.  We were told by many that you close your vents manually.  Who wants to do that? It could be 30 degrees at night here, then 65 in the day during fall and spring.  Temp-Vents open and close automatically and don't even use electricity or batteries - and they really do look nice.

In the ceiling box The black wire feeds the switch so you tie it to a hot circuit(should already be done but will usually be black) and the red you tie to the hots of the ceiling fan black and blue and white to white and green to green. This is if there is only one switch in the wall! If there are two switches then its a little different. What has happened here with a single switch is that the fan allows for two but aren't necessary. The black wire is usually for the fan motor and the blue(slightly smaller) is for the lights(if there are no lights then don't wire the blue it's there for later light expansion.)

I could sell it for three thousand and five or spend another 800.00. If I spend the eight, the mechanic assures me it will be fine. Until the next time it developes another problem. I know this is difficult to answer without all the specs but I am just looking for a general answer. I would be grateful for any help I get. I have an '88 Bronco with a rebuilt engine. I can afford to but another used car for 5,000. but I wonder if it will be any better. Also, I don't know to much about cars, how to select a good used, that is. The mechanics assure me the bills are high because it is a V-8 with 4-wheel drive and worth the money. What with gas prices and all, I am beginning to wonder if I should just get something else. Please Help. I appreciate your answers.","First of all, an '88 Bronco is not worth anywhere near $3500.00. Try more like 1500-2000 IF it is REALLY nice. The rebuilt engine adds zero value. When the engine died, it was worth Zero. The fixed engine restored the value to the previous condition. A good rule is that if a vehicle is more than 80% depreciated, if the repair cost will exceed half the value of the vehicle, throw it away and get a different vehicle. For example, your Bronco sold for about 14,000 when new. It is now worth about $2,000.00 Therefore it is 85% depreciated. It is a close call, but I would be tempted to sell it for whatever I could get and take $4,000 and buy a newer vehicle. Fire your Mechanic. These Broncos are inexpensive to work on. Sounds to me like he is taking advantage of you. V8 engine repair bills are not higher than any other type of engine, and the 4wd has nothing to do with any repair that is not part of the 4wd system. If your mechanic thinks it is a great truck then sell it to him. And FIRE HIM IMMEDIATELY!!! A Good Mechanic will never tell someone whether or not a repair is worth doing. He will Educate and inform, but should NEVER make that judgement call. Interesting that the Judgement call he favors is YOU spend BIG MONEY with HIS REPAIR SHOP!!! Does he have a Kid in College? A new Corvette to pay for?   Good Luck!"

Disassemble the door’s handle and lock by first removing the screws on the side of the handle and sliding out the mechanism.2. Reattach the damaged veneer and cracked areas of door by mixing up epoxy and filling the cracks using a tongue depressor.3. Place a piece of wax paper over the area and secure the damaged door with a woodworking clamp while the epoxy hardens.4. Since the original opening for the lock mechanism was incorrectly cut, you'll need to use a section of dowel to fill the opening so you can start over.5. Pick a dowel of the appropriate diameter and cut about a 4-inch section. Score grooves along the length of the dowel piece to give the epoxy something to bond to. A good way to do this is by clamping a handsaw upright on a workbench and carefully dragging the dowel across the teeth of the saw.  6. Mix wood epoxy and spread along half of the dowel. Insert dowel into lock hole. Apply the woodworking clamp again while epoxy hardens, about 30 minutes.7. Cut away any excess dowel with a pull saw. Cut as close as possible to door without damaging it. Fill all remaining depressions with adhesive filler.8. Smooth down the area with a rasp followed by sandpaper.9. Drill new hole through dowel for lock using a paddle bit. Orient the doorknob and mark the edge of the mortise while holding the lock plate in position on the door edge.10. Score out the cut for the mortise using a utility knife. Make sure to stay inside the lines you drew.11. Chisel out a mortise, about 1/8-inch deep, using a chisel and hammer.12. Pre-drill holes for mounting lock plate and attach with screws. Reassemble doorknob mechanism and re-hang door."
2761,23439,How do I keep gasoline from leaking in to my oil? I can't check my oil with the dip stick because the gas that leaks into it keeps throwing off the reading.,"A few things leap to mind. First, gas in the oil is very bad. It thins the oil to the point where it is no longer lubricating the engine, and your engine will self-destruct if you run it. Second, what you now have in your engine is an explosive vapor. It can explode, or at least ignite. Third, well, there is no third, since the first two are enough to ruin your day. The problem often occurs when a mechanical fuel pump driven off the camshaft develops some kind of leak and pumps gas into the crankcase. I used to work for a VW mechanic, and I fixed this problem several times, including the part about draining rather explosive oil from the engine. It can also occur if your carburetor or fuel injection system has a problem like a stuck float needle or some other problem that is allowing fuel to be dumped into the engine. If you do not get it fixed, you will not have to worry about checking the oil, at least not in this car. Maybe the one you replace it with, but not this one."

Don't have model with me but if its the fuse, where is it located? If not the fuse, what else can go wrong.","Some appliances, notably microwave ovens and CRT-type TVs (normal TVs), have electrical storage parts called ""capacitors"" inside them and also very high (higher than 110VAC) voltages. The combination means that even unplugged these appliances harbor dangers within. Like applpro said, I'd be *very* hesitant to recommend that a DIYer open either of those appliances for the simple reason that you might give yourself a nasty shock.That said, if the microwave has a fuse, it is almost certainly either in an outside-accesible holder (on the backside), or very near the 110VAC service entrance, well away from the (hopefully shielded) high voltage supply for the microwave generator.  Carefully examine the backside for a fuse holder cover. If not found, take it to an appliance repair person.You should confirm that the power outlet used by the microwave is ok.But, I doubt it has a fuse. If the microwave is ""dead"", probably some part of the powersupply has died, or perhaps some part of the brain.  In either case, diagnosing the problem can be a real chore, repair would likely require replacing whole circuit boards rather than single components ($), the manufacturers don't generally sell the boards to DIYers (liability risk), and when it's all done you've invested more effort than you would buying a new microwave oven."

I have tried hooking up a refridgerant hose to the red port but it does not fit.  The red port is a little to large.  So whats up?,"R-134a uses a different fitting and a different set of guages to properly charge your system. The 134 guages are calibrated different from the old R-12 guages. This does not mean you can't use your R-12 guages (assuming you have any) you just have to know what the pressure differential is. Adapters can be purchased to fit the fittings on your car. The color of the cap is irrelevant, that is just a GM thing. You did not mention whether the fitting was on the liquid line (small line) or suction side (large line), I will assume it is the suction side for now. GM and other manufacturers have moved the other fitting closer to the AC compressor, look where the lines come off the compressor, especially underneath on the bottom, you will likely find the fitting there.

There is no visible fuel spray from the injectors nor does it have ignition spark.,"On my 94 K1500 Blazer, you have to take a wire or paper clip and short two of the ALDL (Assembly Line Data Link)terminals together. It should be located close to the steering column, underneath the dash. It will probably have 12 individual pins, two rows of 6. Short the two that are farthest right on the top row, and turn the ignition to ON (DO NOT start the engine).What will happen now is the Check Engine Light will flash the codes that are stored. It will start with Code 12 (only means that you're in diagnostic mode), which will be one flash, a pause, and two flashes. It'll do this twice more, and then any stored codes will be displayed in the same manner. If there aren't any codes stored, Code 12 will repeat."

2790,22825,How to prune a house plant cactus? ,"Occasionally a cactus will need to be pruned. It may have rotting stalks, or just seems to be getting unruly looking. The problem with pruning a cactus is that they scar easily, so any cuts should be made should angle inward and be out of sight. Another thing to keep in mind is that branches will not grow from where the cut was made and that a cactus grows very slowly. Cactus will generally only grow a few inches a year, but will live for many years. Prune cactus & succulents (if necessary) in the active growing season, let dry and callusing the wound surfaces allowing a good air flow and removing detaced branches.Here's a great site with directions, photos and tools:http://www.cactuspruner.com/Cacti are such great houseplants.

2832,66120,How do you remove scratches from stainless steel refrigerator doors? ,"Scratches are difficult to remove. Most kitchen appliances, sinks, and counters have a polished finish with short directional polishing lines. Restoring a polished finish to its original appearance requires a professional such as a company that specializes in fabricating or polishing stainless steel. If the refrigerator or dishwasher door panel is replaceable, purchasing a new panel is normally more cost effective than professional refinishing. The homeowner may want to consider obtaining replacement panels with angel hair, distressed, swirl, or embossed finish. These finishes help to hide light scratching and can be obtained from companies that specialize in stainless steel finishes.Counters and appliance doors that are not easily removable must be refinished in place. When the counter is refinished, it may have long rather than short polishing lines. If a slightly different finish is acceptable and cost is a consideration, a homeowner can refinish the counter or appliance using a non-metallic abrasive pad such as a Scotch Brite® pad. This can be done by rubbing the surface with the pad using long uniform strokes in the same direction as the current polishing lines. This will not eliminate deep scratches. A professional may offer this finish as a less expensive option. The resulting finish is normally referred to as a hairline or long grain finish. Some appliance companies are starting to offer this finish."

2875,30131,"how do you change the automatic transmission fluid,filter,and gasket on a 93 caprice 5.7liter? how many quarts ","Remove the transmission pan, use an oil drain pan to catch all the fluid that will come out of the sides of it.allow fluid to drain out. The filter is easily viewed once you remove the pan. To remove the filter itself all you have to do is pull it off, theres no screws to it.  Make sure you also remove the grommet that is left in the hole where the filter came out of (it usually gets stuck in there). Replacing the filter all you have to do is push it in, usually it pops in there and when it doesnt fall out all by itself that means its on.Clean magnet on transmission pan. This is a good inspection point to see if you have any metal shavings. A little bit of shavings is normal, but when you start finding small chunks this is a sign of a serious problem.Remove all gasket material on trans pan and bottom of the transmission where the pan gasket goes. Make sure both of these surfaces are dry when replacing the gasket.Replace pan gasket and transmission pan. When tightening bolts make sure you do not OVER tighten. This could squeeze the gasket and cause a leak. Do NOT apply silicone to the gasket, they counter each other. By rule of thumb you can tighten the bolts using a wrachet holding your hand close to the head of the socket, when you can no longer turn the wratchet just using one hand then thats as tight as they need to be (75-80 lbs torque).Refill with fluid. Use any Dexron III fluid. it doesnt have to be from the dealer. Fill the transmission with 4 quarts and then start the vehicle, DO NOT DRIVE! Add the remaining amount while the car is running untill you reach the top mark (FULL or Warm) on the dipstick. This will usually take another 2-3 quarts, check the dipstick after you add each one.Your transmission on the caprice can hold 12-13 quarts total. When doing a transmission service it only lets out about 6-7 quarts.When topped off cycle the gears a coulple of times between reverse neutral and drive untill you feel it firmly gets into gear.  Now test drive the vehicle around the block (not far) bring it back and check the fluid level to make sure you are full, add fluid if needed. there your done.WARNING: if you are doing a fluid change because your transmission is having problems then there is a 50/50 chance your transmission will no longer work after you do the fluid change. In that case you needed an overhaul anyway. Sometimes the crap and material that is hanging around the fluid is the last leg of what is holding your transmission together and comes out with a fluid change."

Roaches tend to infest neighboring houses and trees, so you will probably have to retreat the house regularly.  Another thing you can put down is diatomaceous earth, or silica.  This is very effective since they track it back to the nests and it helps kill other roaches too.  It's a very sharp almost microscopic partaicle that cuts throught their carapaces, causing them to lose bodily liquids and die, almost like bleading to death."
2897,45404,How should you prepare your car for winter? ,"check all the fluids. the coolant should be a mid dark to mid light green, with almost a sweet odor to it. check the oil and tranni fluid. the older the fluid, the thicker it gets. for the winter time, a thinner weight oil is usually reccommended because oil thickens up at lower temps and it takes a longer time to oil the engine. a lighter oil means better start up protectionbeefy tires are needed unless you have all season tires. tire pressure should be checked at least twice a month. also, make sure to check if your heater works."

2900,102883,How do I get my basement to stop flooding? ,"OOH, that one involves some work.The most effective is to rent an excavator, possibly a mini depending on your yard size.Then you did out the ground in front of the house where it is taking in water. Enough room has to be there in order to refinish the wall to become waterproof. This could be masonry work, cement, you'll be able to tell once you get to that point.After that is done, back fill the dirt, and head to the basement. I used masonry caulking on the floors around my leaks.Another way is to hire the people who waterproof your basement for you. it will save you time and aggravation, I promise. They know what to do and what to look for. maybe they can come out and offer you some advice.Good Luck.I bought a product called DAMP RID at Home Depot to hang up in the areas of moisture.It's about $4.00 for a month's worth of help."

2908,82209,How do you use a snake to clean out a drain? ,"First, don't go directly down the drain. If you are snaking a sink, remove the p trap and go in from there. If you are snaking a tub, remove the overflow cover and go in from there. If you are snaking a toilet, it is best to remove the toilet and go directly in the pipe so you don't scratch or mar the porcelain. Push the snake in until it won't go anymore then tighten the locking wingnut or squeeze the handle, whatever mechanism there is, to lock the snake in place, and start turning the handle. This will eventually push the snake past whatever stopped you, whether it was the clog or just a bend in the pipe. Whenever I snake a drain, I run the full length of the coil into the pipe just to make sure I got everything. When you've reached the end of the coil and start pulling it back out, make sure you're cranking the handle. This will clean out all the accumulated crap stuck to the walls of the pipe, to reduce the chance of future clogs."

Recommend a solution-ROHIT,"Don't accelerate too hard, soft press is enough in city conditions. Judge the crowd on the road and possible stoppages at traffic signals, avoid acceleration if possible. Ensure that your hand breaks are completely released and your wheels are free. You should not ride on your clutch pedal unnecessarily.Have your car serviced at regular intervals, particularly before and after rains.If you have to halt for more than two minutes, switch off the engine.Avoid giving to others your car for driving. Different handling cause damage to the vehicle operations.Try driving at the highest possible gear (no rash driving) at the earliest of each driving session.Driving vehicles for short distances cause more fuel consumption. Engine optimises after 20-25 minutes of running.Car tyres should always have the manufacturer recommended air pressure."

2924,123608,How do you remove broken bolts? I have 2 broken bolts in a housing on my outboard motor that I can't get out. ,"Had the same problem this spring. The bolts that you are probably referring to is in the powerhead unit. These are not your ordinary drill out type of bolts and then use an easy out like everyone here is recomending to you. Outboard motors are a unique repair due to the useage of them in SALT water with the corrosion in the head around the bolts. These cannot be removed by yourself. they must be taken to a machine shop to have them removed professionally. This is not an easy task or is it a cheap repair. These bolts alone are made for outbord motors and must be replaced with the same type of outboard replacement parts. The cost for labor and parts can run you several hunded dollars or maybe even over $1000. Best bet is to take it to a repair shop that does this every day, probably at a marina.  I dont know your model or size of this outboard but after you get this estimate , carefully decide weather the cost of the repair is worth the repair. Consider how many hours you have on this outboard. If your estimate runs into the thousand dollar or higher, and you have a lot of hours on the engine, then you may be more apt to buy a new outboard engine. I went this route about a month ago and decided that my $2200 estimate and 500 hours on my engine was not worth it. i bought a new outboard in another state and towed it home. I put my outboard for sale on E-Bay and sold it at a decent price to offset my new outboard price.Good Luck and think before you repair."

Thinset those boards, then staple or screw them into the underlying floor.Good luck!"

Take the old pads out.  Using the bungee cord, hang the caliper somewhere that will give the rubber brake lines some slack.  Take your emory cloth, and sand circles into the rotor.  Not to make marks, more just to remove old brake dust and glazing.  Spray down with the brake cleaner thoroughly.Take the new pads, and follow the instructions on the inside.  You will be greasing where it tells you to...the BACK of the pads where there will be a metal to metal connection.  DO NOT GET THIS GREASE ON THE ROTOR.Place grease on the contact points on the calipers as well.  Use Brake Grease, or high temperature grease.There should be a giant piston on the brake line side of the caliper.  With the c-clamp, depress this.  You may get some fluid spilling out of your brake resevoir, but it's ok.  As long as none of the lines are disconnected, you won;t have to bleed the system.Place the pads in the caliper, put it back on the rotor, tighten and torque the bolts to specification.Open beer."
2931,56854,"How do I release the tensioner for the serpentine belt on a jeep? 2001 Jeep Wrangler with 4.0 liter engine. We have checked the New repair manual and it explains how to change the belt, but gives no info  on releasing the tensioner. The tool that auto-zone says to use doesn't seem to have a way of connecting to do the trick....any ideas?",4.0 liter probably doesnt have a belt tensioner.  Most 4 liter dodge engines you have to loosen the idler pully and then the screw on top of the idler pully screws the idler down when you loosen it.  I could be wrong but I know that most 4 liters i have done are this way no tensioner just an idler pully that slides down when you loosen it. If it does have a tensioner then you should be able to use a 1/4 in ratchet.  Insert into the hole on the end of the tensioner and pull back.  I wrote to someone before about how to change a belt on a jeep.  This is what I said.  not that easy there is no tensioner on a 4.0 liter. First you need a 15mm socket. There is a idler pully on the drivers side of engine in front of teh power steering pump. Loosen the bolt in the center of the pully. Do not take all the way out just loosen a few turns. Then once you have the idler loose you need a 13mm socket and extension. Look down on the back side of the idler kind of on top. THere is a bolt that is about 4 inches long that goes down through the back of the pully. Loosen that bolt and the idler pully will slide down taking tensioin off the belt. Do this until you fel the belt is loose enough to remove. Once you have the belt off put new belt back on follow the diagram on the sticker under the hood. Follow the steps in reverse order to tighten. First tighten the bolt until the belt can be twisted about 1/4 to 1/2 side to side. once the belt is tight enough go ahead and tighten the nut on the idler pully and your done. Before you start it is helpfull to look at the bolt on the back and look where the threads are this helps you to get correct tension. also make sure you have the sticker for the diagram under the hood before you start. If you sont make sure you draw the belt or get one. It can be a pain to put back if you have no diagram. Well sorry so long but wanted to be specific. Good luck.

The cord on most mowers goes thru a small hole on the top or side of the engine cover, around a narrow spool inside of it, and is kept there with a single knot on the other end (inside) of the spool thru a small hole in it. Thus remove the engine cover and when removing the spool observe how the cord is attached on the inside (if there is any left). The new one should obviously be attached the same way. It will probably be evident how the cord is attached on the inside. Winding on the new cord is a trick. You'll note that (if you didn't ruin anything) how there is tension when you turn the spool a certain direction. You want to wind the cord on in such a way so that when it is pulled it feels the tension as when you turn it with your hand. May have to hold in place with a straight screwdriver to accomplish that when winding and placing the end of the cord up thru the hole. The purpose of that is simply so that it returns to the engine cover after you pull it so you can try again. As little tension as necessary to accomplish that makes starting the engine easier. Hard to explain without illustrations for your model.Not easy but definitely doable - and once you learn how you wont have a problem doing so again."

2964,15420,How do I get rid of rodents in my house without having to actually touch one or even see one? ,"Dude -- I hate to be rude, but let's start with the basics. First, clean your house. I don't mean straighten out the junk, I mean CLEAN. Throw stuff away. Use Pinesol (it comes in scents, now, not just that pine tar smell) or some other type of cleaning agent that does not require rinsing (the underlying pine scent helps repel all types of critters). Clean out under all your sinks (bath and kitchen) and throw away anything that is not absolutely required. Close up all holes in all walls -- such as where pipes come in under sinks and behind gas ranges (rats and mice love crawling along hidden pipes -- they are a veritable rodent raceways).  Check also behind your 'fridge, particularly if you have an icemaker (the water source has to come from some where). Ensure your dryer vent has some way of closing when not in use (there a lot of options available at every hardware store). Find, dry and repair the source of all water leaks -- those buggers really need and seek out water (there might be a double whammy if there is a leaky pipe hidden in a wall or ceiling -- that just needs fixing).  That includes emptying the drip tray under your fridge.  Those buggers can live under that fridge in the warmth drinking from that drip tray. Repair all openings in the siding of your house -- those buggers are getting in somewhere.  Repair or replace all screen doors (I had a 3lb rat get into my house because I left the door wide open on a beautiful spring day. The rat died...so did my dog.) Put your food away. No opened food containers on the counter, stove or fridge. Make sure all of the ""water traps"" are filled in all of your unused bathrooms and toilets (those are the things that keep the sewer gases out of your house, if they dry out they provide an open source for rodents and insects to come in from the sewer (yuck).Now, once you've closed all means for the buggers to get in (and out) it's time to kill those that you have. If you don't mind the smell of putrifying rodent bodies, go ahead and lay out some DCon -- BUT NOT IF YOU HAVE KIDS OR PETS.  I prefer the old fashioned ""clap-traps."" They may be a bit primative, but you don't have rodent carcasses fermenting in places you can't see.  I usually bait the traps with peanut butter and throw the whole thing away once I capture a bugger. If you reuse the traps, you may have boil them to get the smell of the dead one off the trap otherwise you may not catch another one.  Put the traps in corners that are out of the way but are visible enough to see if they caught anything. Keep the bait facing away from the corner. If rats are infesting your house, you may have to fill all of the holes with a combination of broken glass (use broken beer bottles) and steel wool. The rats will chew thru vertually any other material, so the glass/steel wool will act as a rodent barrier underneath the cosmetic caulk or foam filling the hole. You'll get rid of them all if you are merciless and relentless. As nasty as it is, you'll just have go on a full scale attack. Good luck."

Sometimes under a load a poor connection will finally give way.  If I had to guess I would say the outlets were ""back stabbed""; that is, the electrician used the connections on the back of the outlet.

If it's bigger, in a few weeks they'll want to look at it again, and search for the leak using a blacklight to detect the dye."

3027,54102,how do i remove the master cylinder on a 1998 jeep wrangler? ,"remove the brake lines going to the master. Then remove the bolts that hold the master in place on the booster. With the new master, put it in a vice, add brake fluid, remove the plastic caps and let the gravity bleed the system until fluid runs from the ports. You can puch from the rear of the cylinder to force the fluid out, but then you would have to hold the piston in and place your fingers over the ports before you let go of the piston on the rear of the cylinder. Do this until fluid drips freely. then install the master on the booster without the lines yet. Have someone go inside the car and slowly push down on the brake pedal, once they go all the way to the floor, DO  NOT LET THE PEDAL MOVE BACK UP! this will allow air in the system. So when the pedal is on the floor, you go and install the 2 lines back onto the master. One the 2 lines are both on and tight, have your partner release the pedal back up. What this does is pull the air out of the lines and into the master. Top off the master til full, put the cover back on and your done. Test the pedal. If the pedal is spongy , then you allowed air into the system and you need to bleed it. But that is for another question if you need it.Good luck...Ron"

Not knowing how old your unit is,  on most ranges the oven control knob will pull straight off the shaft and reveal the valve behind.

3039,109479,How do you Spackle a wall that has pieces of dry wall missing from slight water damage? -water leak is fixed-want to paint but need to fix the wall first-there is not a hole just some of the outside surface is worn away on the wallplease help,"You need to determine if the drywall has been cracked or compromised in any way.  If it has it might not be a simple matter of spackling. You may need to cut a hole square and then shave about a third of the drywall off around it.  Then get a piece of screen, like from an old screen door, cut it to fit the shaved area, and then spackle it in.  Be sure to apply a little spackling before you put the screen in so it has something to stick to from the back as well as the front.  Then wait until the spackling dries and add another layer. Lat that dry as well.  Keep adding successive layers and letting them dry until the spackling is roughly flush with the surrounding surface area.  Then you need to take some 200 grit sandpaper and sand the dried spackling until it's as smooth as it can be and there is very little if any differentiation between the spackled area and the surrounding area.   If you don't think your drywall has been cracked or compromised just forego cutting a hole and add successive layers of spackling.  Let it dry and then paint over it."

3051,52659,How do i Disable the factory Anti-theft system in my 99 cavalier.  It goes off now after i replaced my battery 1999 Chevy CavalierOwned for 3 years and never even knew it had an alarm!,"If you are hearing a siren sound instead of the horn honking, then you have an aftermarket alarm.  I'm guessing you don't have a key fob or you would have known you have an alarm, so it is possible that the previous owner installed an alarm and as most people do, lost the fobs and just never armed the alarm again.  When you changed the battery, it activated this aftermarket alarm.  Before I tell you ways to deactivate an aftermarket alarm, let me tell you about the factory alarm in your Cavalier.  Your Cavalier is equipped with the chevy passlock system.  In brief, there is an optical sensor in your ignition that recognizes the cut of your key to prevent theft.  There is an ""Anti Theft"" indicator light in your instrument cluster - this is why you think you have a factory alarm.  This light only indicates that you have the passlock system.There are a few ways to turn off an aftermarket alarm.  Without the key fob, all you can do is to put it into ""valet mode"" which is kind of like putting the system in hibernation.  First, disconnect your battery again, put the key in the ignition, turn the key forward to the on position (past the position where you can listen to the radio, and before all the way where your car would start cranking) and re-connect the battery.  If there is no siren, then turn the key forward and start the car.  Look for a red LED light somewhere on your dash to stay lit (not blinking).  It is now in valet mode and your car is as it was before you changed the battery before.  If this doesn't work,  some of the older aftermarket alarms can be disabled by turning the key to the on position and back to off and repeat for a total of three times. (with the battery connected) If both of those don't work you will need to find either a silver toggle switch or a small round black button - normally mounted somewhere under the dash around where your left foot would go.  Try to leave your finger on the button and turn the ignition forward to on, or with the ignition forward push the button (or flip the toggle switch).  As with the first method, you will know you have succeeded when the red LED stays on without blinking. Good luck.Once you have the car in valet mode, take the car to a stereo shop and have the alarm removed (unless you don't mind repeating the above whenever your battery dies or gets replaced).  Most shops will only charge you 1 hour labor to remove the alarm."

3056,92733,how do you replace the fuel tank on a 1987 gmc pickup truck? ,"First, make sure you either drain the tank or run it down as far as possible. If your truck has a carb engine, the first thing you will need to do is to disconnect the fuel lines from the sending unit in the tank. If your truck has fuel injection, you will need to relieve the pressure in the fuel system before removing the lines. If you should happen to forget to do this, don't panic. You will just have some spray when you disconnect the lines. Once you have removed the lines from the sending unit, next remove any wiring for the sending unit. You may find it easier to remove the wires, and the fuel lines for that matter, if you  lower the tank a little.  If your tank has a rubber hose type filler neck, make sure to remove it from the tank. You can lower the tank slightly be loosening the gas tank straps that hold the tank in the truck. When you are sure that you have disconnected everything, you can remove the straps from one side at a time. You may need an extra pair of hands, too! Slowly lower the tank down and out. Installation is just the reverse."

Many people use 'Solid Color Deck Stain' This product is a solid color that looks like paint, however you can still barely see the grain through it.Good Luck...Decks are notorious for peeling when they are painted."

3063,138164,"How do you fix a small engine that has been stored on its side? At the pool I work at, some well-meaning parent shoved a pressure washer into a closet and stored it on its side.  The engine is a Honda GC190, and it was stored with the starter/flywheel assembly facing down.  Inspection of the airfilter showed that it was covered in what appeared to be motor oil (from crankcase breather tube maybe?) and the engine wouldn't start, it would turn over, but not start.  There is still enough oil in the engine and fuel as well, plus the oil in and around the air filter also got all over the carburetor and choke plate, so that probably is a problem too.  If anyone knows what to do to get it up and running again, the help would be much appreciated.",First off get a new plug. Spray a bit of WD40 into the plug hole and let sit for a while. That will or should breakdown what ever oil got into the piston area. Put fresh gasoline into the tank. Then try to start. May take awhile to blow any excess oil out. Also put a new breather filter on the carb.

Always try it on a covered patch of the fabric before doing it on the entire seats."
3066,68608,how to do a tune-up on an engine? ,"Like most places in California, the hot topic around the water cooler at our office is the rising cost of gasoline. We have seen a drastic increase in gas prices over the past several months and we haven't even reached the summer yet. There has also been talk of premium unleaded costing three bucks by the time summer exits. Thank god my commuter is a Miata (stop laughing) and it gets a gas-sipping 30 miles a gallon on the highway, unlike my other four vehicles, which are only able to muster 20 or so miles per gallon. Keeping them in top shape is a major priority. As many of you might already know, a well maintained vehicle not only saves you money at the pump but can also increase performance. Everyday commuters can easily perform some of these tips while some require skills and specialized technical equipment. We will rate each task on a one to 10 scale so you can decide for yourself whether you can perform these tasks or if you should have a hired mechanic perform them for you.1 One of the easiest and simplest preventative steps you can take is checking tire pressure. If a vehicle's tire is not inflated to the proper specifications, it can cause additional drag on asphalt, slowing the vehicle down. Not only can the situation waste gas, but it may also lead to hazardous driving conditions. First check the manufacturers pressure rating on the tire's sidewall. It should read something like ""maximum tire pressure xx"". With that information, inflate the tire pressure of all four tires to two or three psi below the maximum pressure. Never inflate the tire past the maximum pressure! Difficulty: 2.2 If you love your car you must be religious, not it the sense of believing in God, but religious in the sense of changing your oil. Oil and filter changes should occur every 3000 miles or even more frequently depending on driving conditions. Changing your oil can be as easy as going to the nearest Jiffy Lube or similar establishments. If you are a do-it-yourselfer it can be as cheap as $10 if you buy all the parts from your local parts store. Dirty old oil can easily turn into sludge, hindering moving parts from moving freely, causing performance loss, poor fuel economy and increased wear. Difficulty: 1 or 3 for the do-it-yourselfer.3 Another cheap upgrade is your spark plugs. Not necessarily with high performance exotic alloy units, but just new factory replacements. An average conventional spark plug has a lifespan of about 30,000 miles. Anything past 30,000 miles, and the spark plugs electrode has probably worn off. Spark plugs should be checked every 10,000 miles for wear on the electrode and if needed, replaced with new ones. Difficulty:: 2 to 4 depending on vehicle.4 Air filters are used on all vehicles for obvious reasons of course. However, over time and depending on driving conditions, the filter can easily be clogged with dirt and debris. If the engine utilizes a panel filter, it can easily be tapped gently on the floor to remove the large debris. Pressurized air can remove the smaller debris (office duster works great). Make sure you blow the opposite direction of the air flow intake tract to prevent particles from being further embedded into the filter. Cone filters can also benefit from spring-cleaning and there are cleaning kits available to clean the filter. Air filters should be inspected every 10,000 miles and cleaned or replaced when necessary. Difficulty: 3 to 4.5 Depending on what type of ignition system your engine utilizes, some incorporate an ignition cap and rotor for transferring amplified ignition charge to the plug wires. After several hundred thousands transfers of ignition charge, the cap and rotor can wear, which can lead to misfires. The cap and rotor should be checked every 20,000 miles and replaced when the wear is too excessive. Difficulty: 4 to 5.6 Although plug wires rarely go bad, an intermittent ignition misfire can keep you scratching your head for weeks."

3077,60226,"How would you unclog my bathtub drain (not a sexy question, I know)? The bathtub is 50 years old, with a plunger-style tripwaste - i.e., you move the lever that's under the faucet, and it plugs up the drain without your seeing the plug.When you unscrew the cover over that lever, the tripwaste mechanism is supposed to come with.  Problem is, the thing is so old that the lever has corroded off and the mechanism/plunger are permanently clogging up the drain.  The tub drains, but very slowly.  I have tried pouring down boiling water, white vinegar, and drano.  Have tried pulling on the tripwaste with pliers.  Even tried using a toilet plunger, which actually helps the water flow slightly faster, but doesn't loosen the corroded mechanism.Plumbers say they'd have to tear apart the wall, for lots of $$$.  Isn't there any other way??  Help!!!","Not many options here. The key is you need to get the plunger out of the drain pipe. You can try a long pair of pliers or a hanger bent in to a small hook (about 1/2"" would be about right). If you can't get it from the tub, you either have to go under or in from behind. If the tub is on the first floor and you have a basement or crawl space, you might be able to get in from there. Otherwise, it's pretty much in through the wall or the ceiling below.Good luck!

3079,78916,how do you get a thick dark lawn? our yard is the worst looking yard in our part of the neighborhood.  all of the yards around ours are thick and dark green.  i would like to know how to make it look like that.,"Here is what I do.Apply weed and feed.Do not let the yard dry out or the grass goes into a dormant stage. (brown)This is probably the hardest thing to do.Resist the temptation to cut it short.Never cut it below 2 1/2 inches. 2 3/4 to 3"" is best. A 3"" cut leaves the lawn looking lush and thick. Instead of using fertilizer I use weed and feed, you can also buy weed and feed with grass seed in it.After you get the lawn looking pretty decent keep adding grass seed through-out the season.The last cut of the year I cut it 2 1/2"" as I will get mold in the spring if it is left to long, but this might not apply to everyone.

3097,31174,"How can I straighten my front door? It hits near the top of the jam before it fully closes, and has a slight gap near the bottom.  It's not wood so can't plane.","If I'm reading your question right, there may be a pretty easy remedy. To correct the hitting near the top of the jamb, remove a hinge screw (closest to the interior of the house) and drive a 3 or 3 1/2 inch screw through the jamb and into the framing beyond. Usually tightening the screw will pull that hinge away from the opposite jamb and correct the scrubbing. However, when you pull the hinge there is a tendency to lift the other side of the door, so watch the margin between the top of the door and the top jamb so you don't create another scrubbing problem there.    The gap at the bottom is not as easy. To correct this you'll need to remove the casing from the hinge side of the door. If you cut the caulking where the casing meets the wall before you pry on it, you'll minimize the damage to the wall finish.  After the casing is off, place a pry bar, screwdriver, or whatever behind the  bottom hinge (between the jamb and framing) and push the hinge toward the other side of the jamb. Watch the gap and see if this helps. If so, drive a wedge behind the hinge and secure it with a small nail. Again, pay attention to the margin at the top of the door to make sure it's not binding. If everything looks OK, cut the excess off the wedge and reinstall the casing. Hope this helps"

3103,88985,How do I get rid of camel crickets? I have these camel crickets in my house (big jumping spidery looking things).  Is there anyway of getting rid of those.  They seem to be multiplying.,"Cave and camel crickets are of little economic importance except as a nuisance in buildings and homes, especially basements. They are usually ""accidental invaders"" that wander in by mistake from adjacent areas. They generally do not reproduce indoors, except in situations that provide continuous dark, moist conditions as well as organic debris to serve as food.Control efforts for camel crickets should include (as much as is practical) eliminating breeding and hiding sites outdoors around the house or building. Piles of bricks, stones, boards, leaves, etc., should be removed. Also, cracks and gaps in foundation or siding or around windows and doors should be sealed. House centipedes are a natural predatory form of control, but most homeowners are uncomfortable having them around, despite their beneficial nature. Occasional, individual crickets can be easily picked or swept up and discarded. If there is a breeding population and chemical control is desired, spraying a residual barrier of diazinon, Dursban or Sevin insecticide around the outside of the house may be of benefit if you apply sufficient spray to reach breeding sites. Spraying household ""ant and cockroach"" insecticide onto indoor floor areas where camel crickets hide or are seen is a last resort of limited benefit."

When do I know to spend $500+ to replace the gasket?","As some of the others have stated, if your oil is a ""creamy tan goo"" on the dipstick, then coolant is getting inside the engine, and will quickly ruin the engine bearings from lack of lubrication. But even if the manifold is only leaking externally, you should still have it repaired in the near future. If you're leaking coolant, you're risking overheating the engine and doing a lot of damage and/or being broke down somewhere. JMHO."

If you want an accurate assessment you will need to call an appraiser.  A Realtor can give you an idea of what similar homes in your area have recently sold for or are currently listed at.  The websites out there are just crap.  They use loan info to give you a value.  My house was bought with cash,  one website (zillow) values it with the foreclosure amount of the previous owner from 2 years ago (nothing to do with current market conditions) and the same website shows our neighbors house (paid 1/2 cash and financed 1/2) for the amount financed as the value of the home.  Another website shows my house being 30 years older than it actually is, bringing the value down.  None of the websites have the square footage correct.  My advice to you would be to have an appraisal done ($200-400) or to call a Realtor."

3112,26297,How can I tighten or repair bicycle tire bearing? my back bike tire is shaking and i know it's not suppose to do that. how can i fix it without having to get a whole new tire.,"Sounds like you are referring to the wheel and not the tire. The tire is the rubber part. Bicycle wheel bearings can be adjusted using tools called cone wrenches. A cone wrench is a very flat wrench that will hold the cone-shaped bearing surface steady while a jam nut is tighted. The cone can be turned to tighten it up so that there is no play, but the wheel still spins easily. Then, using a cone wrench, hold the cone steady while you tighten the jam nut. Not all bearings are adjustable this way. Some may need to be replaced as a unit, which could require pressing the bearing out and pressing a new bearing in. Finally, it should be noted that the bearing is not always the cause for a shaky wheel. It could be that the wheel is not true, and/or is out of round. Truing a wheel can be done with a spoke wrench and some patience. An out of round wheel will probably need to be replaced."

3115,119449,"How do I get rid of ""damp"" in a wall? ","The first answer is probably the best one, but you don't say where it is. If it's rising damp, ie coming up from the ground then you need damp proofing - probably best to do this by injection into the wall (see a builder). If it's being caused by something else and is therefore not coming up from the ground then you need to find out where from - is it cos your cavity is ""leaking"" somehow (see a builder) or maybe you have condensation caused by humid air condensing on the cold wall - normally external wall. If its from condensation then you can use a de-humidifier (to take the moisture out of the air) and turn up the heat to dry the moisture form the wall to the air. The you can turn the heat down again and use the de-humidifier either intermittently or constantly - whatever it takes. To reduce moisture in the air try opening window during and after bath,shower,cooking and dont dry clothes inside. If you're not sure about any of this see a builder."

3143,129607,how do I change the coolant on a 1995 Ford windstar? ,"Look for a radiator drain spigot usually on the bottom driver's side of the radiator. Once the engine has cooled, take the radiator cap off and open the drain spigot. About 1-2 gallons drain out into your drain pan which you store in a used plastic container for toxic substance disposal at your local land fill facility. Now close the drain spigot and fill the radiator with distilled water. Put the radiator cap back on and drive the car for at least 30 minutes with the heater on full. Repeat the same procedure after the engine has cooled, driving the car again for another 30 minutes or so. The idea is to dilute the antifreeze concentration in the coolant system to the point that it's mostly distilled water. Finally, empty the radiator one last time and fill it with a 100% concentration of antifreeze. That will give you a 50/50 concentration of new antifreeze since about half of the coolant system capacity is in the radiator and half is in the engine and heater core etc. Run the engine at idle until the thermostat opens and all air is bled out the radiator cap opening. Keep topping off the radiator to keep it full. Put the radiator cap back on and the job is done. You can flush the overflow coolant tank with a garden hose."

The heat from the leak is spreading across two bathroom floors now.,"Subsurface leak detection equipment.  U can't go by where the water shows up.  It seeks the past of least resistance & can show up 50' from the leak.  When I locate leaks I use an air compressor hooked to the boiler drain to the washer or the outside hosebib.  The air is easier to hear than water.  Sometimes if you put your ear to tha slab you can hear the air gurgling coming out of the pipe. You can also drill a 3/8"" hole where you hear it best and when your over it the air will blow out of the hole pretty hard. I have equipment that makes this easy though.

3149,16033,How do i change a starter on a 1991 OLDSMOBILE CUTLASS CALAIS? is there a good wibsite that will tell me how to change it?,"The first and most important thing you MUST do is to disconnect BOTH of the battery cables from the battery. Now, locate your starter and if space allows remove all the wires that are attached to the starter solenoid. Next remove the two large bolts the hold the starter to the engine block. You may need to loosen or remove one or more sheilds around the starter. Once you have removed those two bolts, it should come right out. Now, when you go to install the new starter, be sure to read the installation instructions very carefully. You may be REQUIRED to install a shim between the new starter and the block to ensure proper starter engagement with the flywheel.Once you have determined whether or not you need to install a shim, you can place the new starter in the same location as the old one and reinstall the two starter attaching bolts.  Then reattach all of the wires in EXACTLY the same locations as they were removed.Then reinstall you battery terminal cables and start vehicle.The starter should turn the engine with a minimum of noise. If the starter does not want to turn the engine over easily, the starter is too close to the flywheel and you will need to add a shim. If the starter makes a grinding/whirring sound when engaged, it is too far from the flywheel and you will need to install a thinner shim or remove it all together. I hope that helps!"

I would first make sure the faucet is opening all the way and that it's clear of rust or debris in the valve. Also, I don't know how you heat your water but thew combination of heat and hard water forms scale which usually is worse at the heat source.

3156,47814,How do I change the oil on a 97 Cadillac Catera? ,First of all you will need a torques bit for the drain plug.  Then if you are lucky enough to have a spin on filter you just loosen the filter and put oil on gasket of new one.  remove the old filter spin new one on and tighten 1/4 to 1/2 turn.  And put plug back in and put 6 quarts of new oil in it.  But I have a feeling that since you are asking this question you probably have the canister style filter.  This can be easy or a night mare depending on how tight the filter housing was put on last time.  There is a 3/8 ratchet insert on the end of the oil filter housing but if at all possible I would use a wrench on the big nut instead because the ratchet is in the middle and the housing is aluminum and can be brittle.  Either way you loosen the cap on the filter housing and unscrew it until it comes of then the filter will be inside.  Be care full that the housing doesn't turn.  If overtightened last time the chance of the housing and not just the cap coming loose is imminent.  If the housing comes loose you are screwed especially if your are laying under your car to do it.  If you are lucky enough to get the cap off and not loosen the housing then  just take old filter out and push new one in.  Replace cap and then just like the spin on filter both engines take 6 quarts of oil.

3171,94525,How can you tell if your car has a cracked head gasket? How would u go about checking? (without taking it to a mechanic),"You start at the beginning. A cracked head or head gasket can have various symptoms. While the engine is cool check the radiator water to see if any oil is present. If no then check your oil to see if any water is present (it will look milky). If no then start the engine with the radiator cap off. Look in the radiator to see if it blows bubbles. If no then check the exhaust to see if much water or oil is coming out or is present in the pipe (Some water is there naturally from condensation. If it doesn't smell like anti-freeze you're OK)If no then visually inspect around the head and valve cover to see if any anti-freeze is present.If the answer is no to all of the questions the head and gasket are more then likely intact. The only other test I would recommend would be a compression test, but if you have never done one you may want someone to show you how or go to a mechanic. If you answered yes to any of the questions you probably do have problems in that area, though some could be caused by  mechanical problems other then a blown head gasket or a cracked head."

3188,86278,how can I change the power steering belt to a 1987 maxima? ,"The Car Power Steering System consists of the followings:1. Rack & Pinion Power Steering Gear2. Hydraulic Pump3. Oil Reservoir (you will find a small white plastic or metallic canister with a black cap on it & some traces of red color hydrulic oil, remember another Reservoir opposite to this Oil Reservoir with 'green' or 'blue' liquid traces is for radiator coolant)4. HosesThe Connection:There are three Pulleys:1. Main Crankshaft2. Hydraulic Pump (related to your question)3. Air ConditionerThe Belt connects these three items and in between them there is an IDLER pulley. This pulley is adjustable and is used for adjustment of the belt tension.So, the System works as follows, when you turn ON the ignition:1. The Hydraulic Pump starts pumping the oil to the Power Steering System (supplies pressurerized oil to one inlet, through one of the two main Hoses---called as 'Pressure Port').2. The 'Return Port' sends back  the 'used' oil back to the Oil Resevoir through the other remaining main hose---to make it available for the Hydraulic Pump to use when needed.So the cycle keeps on going until you switch OFF the engine.Changing the BELT (your question):1. Loosen the IDLER Pulley.2. Remove the Belt over the Crankshaft, Airconditioner and Hydraulic Pump pulleys.3. Replace new belt in the same way.4. Tighten the IDLER Pulley. When you tight it, ensure that the tension is about 2-3 mm (press & pull the belt until you get the 2-3 mm up & down belt movement feel---after you place it over all the three pulleys---at the same time tightening the IDLER pulley at the required torque (so that it doesn't gets loosen easily).Ready!"

I have heard that some peolpe don't use pool chemicals instead they use bleach like for cleaning and bakeing soda please help neone,Baking soda is for raising total alkalinity. Use it only if you need to do that. Bleach is a very weak form of chlorine addition. Check your pool water for calcium hardness before you start using it.

3210,8561,How to repair and replace a rearend of 97 Chev. Sliverado 3500 1 ton? ,"you did not state what is wrong with the axle.is the ring & pinion or differential shot?or is there something wrong with the hubs.contrary to what the dude before said, an axle from the 88-2001 GM trucks is going to cost a whole lot more then the previous year 14 bolt rear ends. the rear ends from a 73-87 body style truck are a dime a dozen and should only cost you $100-$200 at a junkyard.the 14 bolt axle had some design changes that started in 1988, and they arent as common as the old version (the old version came in the 3/4 and 1 ton trucks, the 1988 3/4 ton trucks used a semi floating axle as well as the full floating).  also since they arent as plentiful as the old design 14 bolt, they cost more, i would expect to pay in the area of $900+ to from a wrecker.depending on what bearings need to be replace, if its the differential bearings, you can get the entire kit for around $110-$150, and a gear set for $200, and then add $300-$400 for a shop to set them up.  luckily from the 14 bolts design, they are probaly the easiest axle to setup gears on so the shops dont charge as much as they would say a Dana series axle.they also charge less if you just bring them the housing out of the truck instead of the entire truck, its easier to replace everything while it is sitting on a bench instead of under the truck."

If the bubbles are constant, or if the dot does not look magnified, the system is empty.The other type has a round center in the body of the sightglass, and just the top is glass, and it will have a colored dot in the center; this dot is the moisture indicator.  This dot varies in color depending on the manufacturor of the sightglass, but usually should have a plastic cap that covers the sightglass to keep it clean.  The cap will tell what color is normal and what color it will change to if it senses moisture in the system.  If it indicates moisture, have it checked by a pro; moisture can react with the chemical makeup of the refrigerant, and can form an acid, which can reek havoc on your compressor, and that can be very expensive to repair.  Getting rid if the moisture now will be cheaper than a new comp., or new unit"

3215,26825,how to take out a broken bolt from the crankshaft? i broke a crankshaft bolt froma chrysler cirrus so how do i get it out,take a center punch and punch the broken bolt on center. it most likely wont be big enough to get an easy out in it without it snapping off. If that happens you will have to dental burr the broken easy out piece out which sucks.  You will need to find the size of the bolt and what the tap drill size is for it. you can acquire a Garrett card that tells you tap drill sizes for cheap at a hardware store. Get the proper size drill bit and drill it out. then the proper size tap for the whole and re-tap it.  If there is enough of the broken bolt sticking out you may get lucky and be able to grind a flat on two sides and use a wrench or vise-grips.

I can add airconditioners on windows but want to know something better that can save money or else i have to go to central airconditing.Also does any one know better company for installing central airconditing.,"You dont need an air conditioner for the attic. If you go to HD or Lowes you can get an attic fan which costs $90 and would be much cheaper to run.  Putting an air conditioner in the attic would cause problems any way. Central air does not get directed into the attic, just the house, so that wont help your situation. Also dont forget if you air condition the attic then you are looking at some major moisture problems in the summer which is probably what you are trying to avoid. This in turn would warp the flooring and possibly ceiling below. Also it would cause mold problems from drastic temperature change."

3226,67050,How do you stop when you drive manual transmission car? Using the brake or Downshifting. Are not you concern about your transmission more then your brake pads considering the difference in their price.,"The obvious answer for me is to shift the car into neutral and then use the brakes.  Brake pad replacement is one heck of a lot cheaper than a clutch replacement and that's not the only thing that wears on on the transmission!Everytime you shift gears you exercise the syncromesh  associated with each forward gear.  Reverse generally doesn't need any such syncromesh which is why sometimes it is difficult to get into reverse.The clutch throw-out bearing is given a large break too when you leave that clutch pedal out as much as possible.  In that possition the throw-out bearing is not being used.  Held down to the floor, the throw-out bearing is working it's tail off!When the transmission is in neutral the engine speed decreases to idle speed, around 800 rpm.  At that point I am using very little fuel while the ground under the tires is still passing under the car pretty quickly.  That translates to fuel economy!  A quick kick up in rpm and I can put it in any gear I want.The only reason I can give for downshifting through your deceleration is to gain the capacity for a quick acceleration.  That is easily solved with some defensive driving techniques and it really isn't that slow shifting into whatever gear I want when I need it anyway!My '90 Honda Prelude has 230,000 miles on it's original clutch!  The only thing that has been replaced is the clutch acutation parts since that is controlled by hydraulics with a master and a slave cylinder similar to the brake system."
3227,66137,how do i measure my roof for shingles? ,"In order to estimate how many shingles you'll need, first you need to estimate  the total square footage of your roof's surface. Just measure the length and width of each plane on the roof, including dormers. Then, multiply length x width to get the square footage of each plane. Simply add the square footage of each of the planes together to derive the total square footage of your roof.EXAMPLE:Plane 1: 120' x 100' = 12,000 sq. ft.Plane 2: 120' x 100' = 12,000 sq. ft.Plane 1 + Plane 2 = 24,000 sq. ft. for the total square footage of the roof.Roof surfaces are measured in ""squares."" A ""square"" is an area of roof which measures 100 square feet. To determine the number of squares on the gable roof above, for example, simply divide its total of 24,000 square feet by 100. Which means you will need 240 ""squares"" of shingles to cover it. The most common type of shingle, called a three-tab or strip shingle, is generally packaged three bundles per square.If this is a new roof, you will also need 240 squares of underlayment (no underlayment is needed if you are applying shingles directly over an existing asphalt roof). Underlayment usually comes in rolls of four squares each, so covering 240 squares would require 60 rolls of underlayment.Good luck!"

3229,127439,How does a car AC compressor work?If any one know some webs and pictures about it please send me.? ,"""The air conditioning system in your car is comprised of a compressor, condenser, expansion valve and evaporator. If you have ever used a can of compressed air to clean computer components, you will know that the bottle gets very cold in a short amount of time. This is due to the rapid expansion of the compressed gas. The same thing happens in your car’s air conditioning system. Refrigerant (AKA Freon) is compressed in the compressor and turns into a hot gas. In the condenser, this hot gas is cooled to a liquid state and travels to the expansion valve. As the Freon goes through the expansion valve it returns to a low-pressure gas and rapidly cools in the evaporator. A fan blows over the evaporator and cools the air that eventually blows out your vents."""

3233,136715,How do you kill crab grass? ,"To get rid of crabgrass it helps to know its life cycle. When spring soil temps (at a depth of 2""-3"") reach 55-60 degrees Fahrenheit, the first crabgrass (also spelled ""crab grass"") seed will germinate. From mid-summer to fall, crabgrass produces seed. The crabgrass plants (but not the seeds) are killed by frosts in autumn. Preemergent herbicides (also spelled ""pre-emergent"") come in either granular or liquid form and kill crabgrass seedlings as they germinate.Think of preemergent herbicides as forming an invisible shield across the soil surface that stops emerging crabgrass dead in its tracks. This shield image will serve as a reminder not to practice core aeration on lawns after applying preemergent herbicides, since doing so would only ""puncture"" the shield. Aerate lawns beforehand, instead."

3235,111663,how do I change the ice maker copper pipe in a refrigerator? I have plastic pipe now & want to put copper pipe to avoid any leakage -,"If you are talking about the water line that feeds the refrigerator, I wouldn't suggest changing it to copper, simply because the plastic hose is more flexible and won't crack if bent in the same place repeatedly.If you are set on making the change, make sure that you can do so without pinching or kinking the copper line (this includes when you push your fridge back into place).  The copper fittings are similar to the plastic, as both plastic and copper line make use of compression type fittings.  Make sure to get the same size pipe as the old hose with the proper fittings.  You can get these by asking for assistance at most hardware stores.  You will need a reaming tool to make sure the copper pipe flares at the end and is smooth.  This may also be obtained at most hardware stores.  Then cut to the pipe to the proper length, make sure you have smoothed and flared both ends of your pipe, connect the pipe to the valve and the refrigerator, and make sure to tighten both fittings properly.Not very hard.  Make sure to watch your fittings for a while to make sure you don't have any leaks before pushing your fridge back in place.If you are referring to a different pipe then I would also say ""good luck!"""

3259,72332,How does a GFCI outlet work?  Does it require a ground? ,"A GFCI (Ground Fault Circuit Interruptor) measures the amperage in a circuit that is being used by the load on the ungrounded (line or hot) conductor connected to it, and compares it to the amount returning on the grounded (neutral) conductor. If the imbalance is more than 5 milliamps (.005 of an amp), it causes the GFCI to trip off within 1/40th of a second. Note: A GFCI is not a circuit breaker, and does not protect against a short or overloaded condition. You can legally install one in a circuit without a grounding conductor (the bare or green wire in your box) but you must attach a sticker that says ""no equipment ground"" to the face plate. New GFCI's come with these stickers in the package. This will allow you to legally install one in an older house that does not have grounded wiring. Hope that helps."

3264,25456,How do I charge a home air conditioner? ,"Your charge will depend on a number of factors.  First, determine the ambient temperature outside.  Then, put a thermometer on the suction line, the bigger of the two pipes on your outside condenser.  Watch the temp of the suction line as you charge the unit.  At 95 degress outside with 68psi of freon on your low side (big pipe) you should have a line temp of 43 - 45 degrees.  Then check the temperature of the air coming out of the vent closest to your a/c inside your home.  Proper outlet temp will be 55-57 degrees.  Do not charge more than 75psi of freon.  This will cause your a/c to not properly change from vapor to liquid to vapor in the cycle.A/C is a tricky  and time-consuming proposition.  If nothing else, hook your blue hose up to the large line Schrader valve (looks like a tire valve) on the outside unit.  Charge it to 70psi and WAIT.  Keep checking the large line temp and the inside vent temp til you get 43-45 degrees outside on the line and 55-59 degrees inside.  Do not over-charge the freon.  As your unit balances the freon in liquid and vapor forms, the pressure will drop, so be patient and use temperature to achieve maximum cooling efficiency.  Stick with 68 - 7O psi on the low-side (large line) on the outside unit if nothing else.  And let it run to allow it to properly balance out the freon.If you get confused, call a tech.  Better to pay him now than make things worse."

You're going to reuse it.Get a couple of wooden strips or thin boards that are long enough to cross the hole. Wooden paint stirrers (free) or wooden yard stick cut down to size will work. so would a wooden ruler.place one of the sticks into the wall cavity so that it traverses the hole. Hold it up against the back side of the existing wallboard and secure it with a screw on each end. You're screwing through the wall and into the wooden strip behind the wall. Repeat with the other strip so you have  2 strips crossing the hole. This is the structure to which you will attach the broken piece. If the hole is small enough or the wooden strip wide enough - only one may be required.put the broken pieces of wall on the floor FACE DOWN and assemble them in their orignial configuration like a puzzle. Use the Duct Tape to hold them together if necessary. Flip the assembly over, and glue any partial pieces on to fill in any holes, trying to achieve a relatively flat wall surface.put the reassembled wall section into the hole, securing it to the strips with either a couple of screws, or glue if the wall section is too broken up to get a screw into. all the screws should be screwed in far enough to leave a little indention. sparingly smooth on the spackling or drywall compound with a putty knife (or spatula), just filling in the cracks and the screw holes. Try to preserve as much of the original wall texture as possible - it's hard to replicate.If you don't have spakling or joint compound, use the white glue. to fill in indentions (like those made by the screws, don't try to fill it in all at once. do one layer, drink a beer while it drys, then repeat.don't worry about glue not drying flat. Sand off the excess joint compound or glue to get a flat surface.Paint and hang a picture over it. Drink the rest of your beer and resolve to not make any more holes in the wall."

If you have wires smaller than a # 3, you probably have an very old 60 amp service, which is pretty rare but I still run into them on occasion.

3269,129605,How do I retreive a lost hard contac lens from the sink drain? ,"Wow, this has happened to me before!  Actually more than once!First, don't run any water or anything down the drain.  The contact might be already gone, but there's a possibility that it's still in the P-trap underneath the sink.  If you put anything down the sink there's a possibility that it might wash out into the pipes and be lost..The P-trap is the curved pipe you see underneath the sink.  Disconnect the P-trap underneath the sink.  First, put something under there to catch the water that will fall out when you disconnect it.  The P-trap is usually held onto the pipes with some rings.  All you have to do is unscrew the rings.  You might need to use a pliers or vice grip to do this.  After you unscrew the rings, just slide the P-trap off the pipe, and dump the water from the P-trap into your bucket or whatever.  Examine this water for your contact lens.Also, sometimes the contact can get stuck to the pipe inside the sink.  There's gunk on there that the contact will sometimes stick to.  So if you don't find it in the P-trap, check the pipe that goes from the sink to the P-trap.  If the contact is in there, you can dislodge it with a long tool (a stick, pencil, whatever).If it's not in that pipe or the P-trap, you probably won't get it back.  Also, if you're not completely sure that it went into the sink, check the floor and other surfaces in the bathroom.  Sometimes it can seem like they fell in there when they really fell somewhere else.  If you shine a flashlight around it makes it easier to locate the contact because it will reflect the light from the flashlight.  You can see the glint of the light off the contact and that's how you'll know where it is.If you find your contact, of course, you will want to clean the contact lens thoroughly before putting it back into your eye.I hope you find it!"

I am not sure how to do this, and I dont want to pay the dealership to fix it.  Also, what kind of bulb does it need and where can I get it?  Thanks",OK there are 2 L shaped metal rods on the top of the headlight assembly.  Turn them and pull them up.  This will allow you to take the whole headlight assembly out.  Once you do that you have to look on the lower section of the assembly that houses the running light.  On the side closest to the middle there is a gray plastic tab kind of U shaped.  You have to push that plastic tab and then the lower section will come out.  The drl is the one on the outside and is a 4157 bulb. Take out the bulb and replace it with new one.  Then when you go to put the lower section back there will be two prongs on the end that must slip in before you push the U shaped tab back in.  Once that is in put the assembly back and install pins and your done.  For pictures look in your owners manual and you will see what I am describing

3276,51424,how do you wrap the freon line of an air conditioner? ,"I'm going to assume you are talking about the copper lines that run between the indoor and outdoor units.  The only line that needs to be wrapped is the suction line, the bigger of the two, which will also be the cold one of the two.  Try Home Depot, or a store like that, ask for pipe insulation; you will need to know the outside diameter of the pipe for the type you can slide over the pipe.  If you can't do it that way, ask for a roll of cork or tar-like insulation wrap.  You simply unroll the wrap at an angle around the pipe, keeping it somewhat taught, andoverlapping it a little for whatever length you need.  It is plyable enough that you can kind of mold it to the pipe.  This will prevent the cold pipe from sweating and getting a layer or buildup of frost."

I find it hard to find information on the net regarding prep work for car bodys so any help would be appreciated.  Thank you!","you first nedd to assess the condition of the bodywork, does the paint have any bubbles ? is there any corrosion that needs repairing such as wheel areches etc ( you dont say what the vehicle is and the age) asuming there is no serious corrosion then you have a lot of sanding to do, if the paintwork and bodywork is in good condition then you need to basically take the shine off the paintwork and ideally coat it with etch primer, the trouble is not knowing what the paint is on the vehicle as some modern paints react with older ones, if this is the case you will need to go back to bare metal to cure the bubbling effect this has, the process is not complicated but it is time consuming, from bare metal you would using body filler (mix in proportions of  filler = size of a golf ball, hardner = size of a pea) you apply the filler to the damaged area and allow to set hard, using as fine a grade of production paper as posssible (less scratches to get rid of later) you sand the repait until it is flat with the panel surface (ifi its curved use something like a piece of plastic pipe, if flat use a rubbing block) you keep repeating this process until the repair is unoticble when you run your hand over it, all repairs must be as good as that.  Next you prime the area using a fine dust coat so that and high or low spots can be seen and repaired this can be done by using a filler putty, this coat needs to be rubbed down with wet and dry (use soap as well it stops the paper clogging) and this process is repeated until all the repairs are complete, then if you wish you can begin applying coats of primer rubbing down with a fine paper in between (soap again) and finally panel wipe (solvent so take care) and tak rag the surface ready for painting, i reccomend several coats of primer to give a deep finish"
3290,128280,How do you care for wood parquet floors after water has been spilled on them? A large amount of water was spilled on the wood floor but was taken up right away.  But it looks as if there might have been some water that soaked into the wood.  What do we do to get the excess water out of the wood and and how do we bring it back to it previous condition?,"You are probably going to have to wait for the wood to dry out.  But to expedite the process get one of those containers by DampRid that has the granules in it to absorb moisture.  Place it in the room along with some oscillating fans.  The DampRid will absorb the moisture out of the air coming from the wood.  Don't put the granules on the wood, just leave it open near to where the spill occurred.Then, once you are certain you have thoroughly dried out the wood, try to use Howards Restore-a-finish in a color similar to your floor.  Because of the variation in parquet flooring, you may need to purchase two different colors.  Fornby's also has a kit you can use, if you cannot find Howards.   Neither one will harm your floor, but if you have warpage as a result of the volume of water, you may be looking at replacement of that area."

3297,102334,How do you check standard transmission fluid levels? I have a 1998 Chevy S10 and would like to check the transmission fluid levels.  How do you check the levels on a vehicle with a manual transmission.,"Let's start with the basics...first of all are you positive you are referring to a manual transmission?  If so, then the answer is easy.  If not, read the owner's manual.  For an automatic transmission, park the vehicle on a level surface and engage the parking brake.  Start the engine and allow to warm up to normal operating temperature.  Raise the hood and look for the brightly colored dip stick near the firewall.  The transmission should be in park when checking fluid.   Also check the color and smell of the fluid.  Dark red to almost black is an indication of trouble and a burnt smell is another indication of problems.Now for the manual transmission.  There should be a small pipe-type plug on the side of the gear case.  Simply remove the plug.  If no oil runs out, add oil until it does.  When full, replace the plug.  Check the owner's manual for the correct lubricant, but I think I used to use the heavy rear-end oil (about 80wt).  Good luck."

I removed the 8 screws but I'm not sure how to remove the panel.The 2 side panels have a lip that overlaps the back panel.I'm trying to get it apart so I can check the belts and drum to see why it keeps binding up.Thank You!,"If I remember right, most older GE dryers do not have removable back panels. The front panel comes off instead. There is srews at the bottom of the front panel at floor level. After you remove those, pull the bottom outward a ways. From there, you can disengage it from the top, and have access to the area under the drum where the motor and belt tensioner pulley assembly is located. On GE dryers that open like this, the back of the drum is mounted to a shaft that goes through a bearing in the back of the dryer accessible through a small removable panel. The front of the drum rides on 2 plastic shoes mounted to the front panel. Check the bearing, guide shoes, and tensioner pulley.

3318,53375,How do i drive a stick???? ,"Driving a standard trasmission vehicle takes practice to become profficient. There are several things your mind and body need to learn  to do at the same time or close to the same time. Using first and reverse gears are the most difficult, and down shifting can take a while to get the hang of as well. First you need to get the car moving. This is where first gear is utilized. While slowly letting up on the clutch you will feel a small pressure point in the clutch. This point is where you know to push in the gas just a tad bit and the car (if done correctly) will move forward slowly. It takes getting a full mind and body ""feel"" of the car, of how the clutch and gas engage each other. While you practice you will jerk a lot and kill the engine. It is getting that combingation of the right clutch release point while giving a bit of gas which starts the car in a forward movement. Once you get the car moving you then shift to second gear. The only gears you need to engage both the gas and clutch at the same time are first and reverse. The other gears can be changed just by pressing in the clutch, changing the gear, letting up on the clutch completely and engaging the gas pedal. Finding the engagement between first, reverse and the proper amount of gas to apply can be difficult at first. Go to a large parking area or a long dirt road and practice. I taught all my kids (8) to drive a standard. We always started with the standard as I feel strongely that once a person masters a standard they will not have any problems with automatics, or trucks, etc. Downshifting is important and can be a bit difficult to master too. Driving a standard requires using much more of your mind and body than an automatic. You have to be aware of the RPMs so you can know when to shift, either up or down. Listening to the vehicle with your mind and feeling how it is responding with your body is required with a standard much more than an automatic. Automatics are easily driven, requires less mental and physical joining with the vehicle and is not as fun. There is more advantages to driving a standard than getting better gas milage or being able to push start it. When driving a standard you can have much more control of the car, and it is simply fun to drive when you are focusing so much of your mind and body with the car. Like I said, just find that point where it feels the clutch has a bit of resistance, slowly press a bit of gas and the car will either go forward, or jerk a lot and then die. As you practice finding that point with the clutch use your whole body to ""feel' the car and what it is doing. That is the best advice I can offer anyone who is getting ready to learn to drive a standard. Now, some are just naturals and it comes to them easily, while others have to practive a lot. Do not allow yourself to get discouraged or think you can't do it. Anybody (unless mentally handicapped) can learn to drive a standard. Just remember that even after you have the car functioning and on the regular road you will still require time to get all the proper shifting down pat with further practice. Try downshifting prior to stopping and making the stop as smooth as possible. Also try making your ""take off"" as smooth as possible as well. By working to make these transistions smooth you will be taking good care of you vehicle. Those who get cocky and refuse to believe they need to learn more finesse in standard transmission minipulation after getting it onto the road are very hard on their vehicles which wears the clutch and other parts more quickly but also put otheers at risk by failing to fully master this type of driving. It is so fun to drive a standard with torc and horse power on a windy road!! It feels like you are one with the car, joined together and it is a blast!! Good luck in learning this type of driving. It is a real skill and if you are patient with yourself and allow yourself to fully master this you will have so muc"

If you are wanting to turn it off further upstream, there may or may not be a valve for doing so somewhere in your basement along the wall where your fireplace is.  Look for the (usually) black gas supply pipe.I personally wouldn't bother to do this.  The valve that you use that is on your fireplace is sufficient.  The one in your basement that hasn't been used is probably a tad brittle and you'll risk damage to it.

3341,111382,How can I locate a broken water pipe under a concrete foundation? Have used a snake and fiber optic camera without success.,The snake and camera are for sewer pipes.  To locate a pressure water leak you need A subsurface listening device such as geophones or fischer locators.  These are like stethoscopes only louder.  I hook up an air compressor to the water line via hosebib.  This makes the leak much louder.  It takes a lot of experience to locate a slab leak so I would suggest calling a slab leak specialist/plumber to locate it for you.  Sewer leaks you can find by performing a hydrostatic test and locate.  Also pretty tricky.  You use test balls to stop up the sewer and fill the drain with water.  If the water in the pipe drops you let the air out of the test ball and move it a couple of feet andtry again.  I would also recommend a plumber for this or it will take forever.  Experienced plumbers will know how to isolate the sewer pipes to make the job faster.  It takes me about two hours to do a full test and locate for drain leaks.  Around $275 to locate water leaks. $475 for sewer.  The smart plumbers will charge by the hour on sewer because it can take all day depending on how many leaks and access.

3346,131841,How can we clean out the buildup in the pipes in our home for drainage? Our home is 100 years old and there is a slight build up in them.,Be very leery of using anything that could harm your pipes. Because of the age and your statement about drainage issues I would suggest calling out a plumber with camera equipment to asses the whole line to make sure you don't have breakage or root intrusion into the pipe. A little buildup shouldn't be causing a problem with drainage. Expect to pay as much as $300.00 for a reputable firm to camera your drain line. It sounds like a lot but using a power auger snake @ $50.00 to $100.00 a day could cause damage in the thousands of dollars if the pipe is weak.

3370,20430,how would i hang a curtain rod? I say even with the molding..my wife says the bracket goes above it.,"I will tell youTools Required:drill/driver, Phillips screw tip, level, pencil, and stepladder. And to make the job easier, use a screw holder extension in the screw gun, and a magnetic level.How to install / hang a curtain rod:(1) Tape 8 ½” x 11” pieces of paper on the wall where the curtain rod mounts will go to prevent unnecessary marks on the wall. It is usually best to put the mounts close to the ends of the Drapery rod, so that you have as much space as possible between the mounts to stack your draperies. If your drapery rod is 120” long, you might center your mounts at 119” to utilize the entire length of the drapery rod. (2) Hold one curtain rod mount up and make sure it is high enough so that the curtains will cover the top of the window. Higher than the top of the window by a few inches may look better, and block out more light. Using a pencil, mark the location of the bottom screw hole on the paper and set the curtain rod mount down while you pre-drill a hole into the wall just deep enough to make it easy to drive the screw nice and straight. (3) Holding the curtain rod mount in one hand, and the screw gun in the other, drive the bottom screw into the wall. Level the curtain rod mount, and drive in the top screw. (4) Put the finials on the curtain rod, go to the other end of the curtain rod, lay the (magnetic) level on top of the curtain rod, hold the curtain rod and the curtain rod mount together and raise them up so the curtain rod is level, and the other end is sitting in the curtain rod mount that you have previously installed. (5) Repeat step 3 (6) Remove one finial, slide the rings onto the curtain rod, drop the curtain rod into place, and slide the curtain pins with curtains attached into the ring eyelets. (7) Remove one finial, slide the rings onto the drapery rod, drop the drapery rod into place, and slide the drapery pins with draperies attached into the ring eyelets. (8) Stand back, pat yourself on the back, and admire the quality and beauty of your new curtain rods made especially for you by Paso Robles Ironworks. How to install an extra long curtain rod:If you are installing an extra long curtain rod with a center connector and center mount, mark the center of the window, and install exactly as above, one side at a time. This means, temporarily install both finials on one of the curtain rod sections, and mount that first half as if it were a separate curtain rod. Then using the same half section with finials installed, proceed to step 4 and install the third mount. Now you are ready to put the entire curtain rod together and with a helper, and proceed to step 6."
3371,88239,"How do I fix my garbage disposal? It stopped working for no reason.I flip the switch and hear a buzzing sound, but it is not chopping.Also my drain is not working well.It is draining very slowly.I stuck my hand in to see if something was blocking it and there is nothing there.I did not stick anything weird down there, so I don't know what is wrong.","I have more service calls on a disposal than any others. The tools you will need are a sevice wrench, flashlight and a pair of long pliers or hemostats. Shut off the power to the disposal first. Then stick the service wrench in the center of the disposal bottom (there should be a place for it on most). If it doesn't have a place to put the wrench, then the only way to unjam it is with a plunger handle stuck inside of the disposal (with the power off) and scraped along the bottom edge to free the cutting element. Either way, your should be able to use your flashlight and pliers to get whatever is out. If the disposal doesnt work after you clear it out, (doesn't turn) try pressing the reset button on the the bottom of the unit. As disposal is only good for what you scrape off of your plate. If you need to throw away larger quantities, it should be thrown in the trash. This will save you the inconvienince and expense of clooging your pipes or wrecking your disposal. Run lots of cold water as well when running the disposal. I've also had to remove coins, wires and even a few shot glasses from them, keep the cap on when you aren't using it. Hope this helps."

After you have the screw out, (he was correct about that part,), the chuck  will unscrew, probably the same way as the screw came out.  If it's a reversible drill motor, then the chuck should be left handed threads as well.  If it doesn't break loose easily, and they seldom do, then take an allen wrench, as big as you can get into the open chuck,  and tighten down the chuck jaws on it.  You may  have to hit the end of the allen wrench with a hammer a few times to get the threads to break free.  The new one should install easier."

3384,18753,how do you drain oil from your car yourself? ,"Before starting, ensure you are on level ground.  Ensure you are in a safe location and can easily and safely get underneath the car.  Be visible to anybody driving by.  For yoru first time, have a friend help you or let someone know what you are about to do.  Unscrew the top where you put your oil in.  Have an oil catcher available (you can buy from any auto parts store).  Put your oil catcher underneath where your oil plug is (under the car) (find the oil plug according to yoru auto manual).  Go under your car and unscrew the oil plug.  It's going to be messy.  Oil will begin pouring out the hole into your oil catcher.  Wait until all the oil is poured out.  (now is also a good time to change your oil filter - but that's another question).  Rethread the oil plug - do NOT overtighten.  According to your manufacturer's manual, put the proper oil back in (i.e., 10-40, 10-30, etc).  You pour it back in where you unscrewed the cap at the beginning.  Put in the amount of quarts your manual states.  Check your oil dipstick to ensure you've put in the proper amount (not too little, not too much).  Good luck!  You can do it and save yourself a lot of money."

3402,91863,How do you repair a bicycle puncture? I have all the tools and a spare inner tube just in case but have only got as far as taking my wheel off!,"Remove the inner tube, by removing the wheel from the bicycle. Ensure the inner tube is fully deflated by pressing on the pin inside the valve. Remove the inner tube from the tyres using tyres levers failing that spoon handles also work well. Never use anything sharp. Try to determine the cause if the puncture. There may be a thorn or piece of glass embedded in the tyre. Run your hand gently inside the tyre to check if there is something sharp. Remove if you find this with say a screwdriver. Alternatively check if a spoke is pushing through, ensure the tape inside the rim is sitting properly. Inflate the tyre using a pump and fill a bowl with water and check if any bubbles escape. If they are escaping from teh valve you will need a new inner tube. If however they are escaping from a hole in the rubber remove the inner tube and dry this area, deflate the inner tube. In your bicycle repair kit you will have a tube of rubber solution and a piece of rubber. Spread rubber solution on the area around the hole with rubber solution covering an area just wider than the rubber patch. Leave about 5minutes to dry. Check the rubber solution should be tacky. Peel off the backing of your rubber strip and apply that previously coated side to the rubber solution. To avoid air bubbles forming press from the center outwards. Once satisfied, grate and dust some chalk powder to prevent any extra rubber solution to sticking to your tyre. Leave another few minutes before gently pumping up the inner tube again about half pressure. Check the hole is now fixed by placing under water again. If all is well then deflate position carefully inside the tyre and inflate to full pressure. Replace and tighten the wheel. You should now be ready to ride again."

3417,63823,How do you remove scuff marks from an old leather gear knob?Or at least make it look a bit better...? ,"If the leather isn't torn or broken in any way then the finish is just worn off.You can go to several hobby supply stores and find leather dye and finish.  They may even sell a finish remover for leather as well.  If not, get some fine sandpaper and smooth out the old leather while it removes the shiny finish.  Once you are happy with how uniform the knob looks, apply the dye.  You don't need to literally soak the leather but you do need to ensure you have applied enough to penetrate evenly around the whole knob.  Follow the directions on the dye.  I believe the dyed knob should be dry before you add the finish.  I've had good luck with squeezing paper towels over the knob and soaking up all the excess while still leaving a uniform color on the knob.  Once no more dye comes off the knob, I think you are ready for the finish.  Add the finish per the directions and then hand buff with a cotton cloth and voila!  A refinished knob!  Perfect in every way... well almost... I've found it too difficult to try and add any contrasting color like some shift knobs have showing you the different gears.  If they are embossed into the leather, you will have to be careful to not sand them away.This should work well for all the leather in the interior.  Good luck!"

3424,67729,"How do I find the condensate drain on my furnace? The manual says to keep it clean, but it doesn't show where it is.","Do you have central air conditioning combined with your furnace?  If not, there may not be a condensate drain.   The condensation is a by-product of running the Air Conditioning.Often, the inside ""coil"" of the AC is located in the larged duct area between your furnace and the ducting that proceeds into your living areas.  So, a furnace in the basement, typically sees the AC coil above the furnace.  Look for tubes that travel from that unit to the box that sits outside.  One of the tubes goes down instead.  it could be a white colored PCV pipe, clear tubing, etc.   Drips of water will travel this tube to drain into a floor drain near the furnace or into a condensate pump (about the size of a shoe box).  This pump will push the water up another tube to the nearest drain -- perhaps a basement washtub sink.Good luck."
3425,5777,"How to know is time to change a new Furnace ? My furnace is 16 years old. It still working, but has small strange sound.  How do I know is time to change a new one?","Many central heating systems last 25 years or more. You didn't mention what type of furnace you have, forced air, hot water and what type of fuel it burns (gas, oil, electricity, propane, wood, coal, etc). Other factors are whether you have air conditioning, a separate domestic hot water heater or combined boiler and domestic hot water heat. Because of rapidly rising energy costs, one approach you can take is to compare the costs of running your current utilities versus how much you could save by upgrading to newer more energy efficient appliances. A 16 year old heat pump or refrigerator for example should definitely be replaced with new energy efficient models that only cost half as much to run. This assumes you don't plan on moving to a new house in the next 10 years or so. New condensation type gas fired hot air furnaces run so efficiently (90%) that they only need a plastic PVC pipe for a flue."

3433,139367,How to fix a riding lawn mower if it cuts off when it is put in gear and sometimes it won't even go in gear. ,"You may have two problems by the sound of it. First you need to check the seat safety switch because it sounds as if that isn't making contact with the bottom of the seat. When you try to shift it into gear the safety shuts the mower down because the safety thinks nobody is sitting on the mower. It's less likely that the linkage for the shifter is broken or just loose. While your under there take a look for a small box looking thing that should be placed by the NEUTRAL setting. The box is a safety device to make you place the transmission in neutral before you can start the mower. Sometimes you can unplug it and the mower will start but if it's a newer mower than it may be loose and just needs to be tightened up. If you find either one of those to be the problem, than go to your nearest auto parts store and get a tube of LOCK-TIGHT and coat the threads before you tighten everything up. I'll bet you find a loose seat safety switch."

3445,126776,How would a car perform if you rig a cold air intake within the passenger cabin? If you install a cold air (high flow) air intake inside the passenger cabin (under dashboard passenger footwell) with tubing into the engine bay and carb... will this make an efficient intake system? Firstly the intake air will be much cleaner and colder and will prevent hydrolock when driving in the rain. It's something similar to a 4X4 snorkel. Has this been done?,How exactly are you going to get the right amount of air flowing through the passenger cabin?  Are you driving a race car with forced air induction from somewhere?  If not then you are wasting your time.  A cold air intake requires you to mount it low OUTSIDE the passenger compartment.  The air wont be colder unless the inside of your car is below 0 and being forced to the motor with a supercharged fan.  Just remember the KISS principle.  Keep It Simple Stupid!  I'm not saying your stupid its just a term.  A 4x4 snorkel is not the same as a cold air intake.  The snorkel allows you to drive your truck through mud and water that is over the level of an unmodified truck.  My truck has a snorkel mounted on the roof and in theory I can drive it through water that deep without stalling.  If I tried to drive it on the highway like that then I would probably loose it or get some foreign debris in it.  Mount your cold air intake inside the engine compartment just above the front valence.  The air going up from under your car will be more than enough.

There are some stain removers that will soften it up and slowly re-dissolve it, but the process is a slow one. Keep the pH at 7.2 as this stuff is a bit more soluble at a lower pH.

The landlord should send someone to the roof to drop a snake down the drain vent and remove the clog. Should you want to remove the p-trap you will need an adjustable wrench to remove the two nuts that hold it in place. You may want to go to a home store or plumbers shop and buy another p-trap if it looks nasty because it might fall apart when you try to remove the nuts.

3464,135372,"How do I repair a leaking toilet flush valve beveled gasket due to a chip in the edge of the mounting hole? I replaced the flush valve in an old Crane toilet. The original beveled gasket between the flush valve and the hole in the bottom of the tank was a softer material that sealed well despite there being a small chip in the inside tank edge of the flush valve mounting hole. The replacement flush valve uses a harder rubber beveled gasket that only contacts the edge of the tank hole, so water now leaks through the chipped area.I cannot tighten the flush valve locknut enough to compress the gasket to seal into the chipped area and cannot find a softer beveled gasket. I am thinking about filling in the chip with J B Weld to bring the surface back to normal. Would that work? Or should I try something different?","There are many kinds of flush valve gaskets to choose from.  If you have a local plumbing supply they should have a better variety than a hardware store.  Take the original up there.  The old Cranes had a special gasket designed just for their toilets. It's thicker than the new universal gaskets that do not fit all toilets properly.  I think the old American Standard gaskets will work on crane,but don't take my word on that.  You do not want to tighten the nut to much or it will crack the tank. I tighten until the tank does not wiggle."

It's not real hard.There should be electrical connectors that run to the brake lights, the harness may or may not attach to the bed, it usually runs along the frame rail. You will have to remove the bedliner if you have one, also, to lighten it up a bit, remove the tailgate. Then remove the fuel fill line (three or four screws) at the bed side. Remove the bolts that hold down the bed, then you can just lift up the left side enough to change the pump, put some blocks of wood on top of the frame, or if you have a strong pal, pick up the bed and slide it back far enough to get to the pump."

For a general overview of stained glass art, see stained glass. A typical copper-foil Tiffany lamp, with a dragonfly designLead-came and Copper-foil glasswork are the arts and crafts of cutting colored glass and joining the pieces into picturesque designs.The traditional method uses lead came. This is the method used for centuries in Europe, mainly in Religious buildings such as cathedrals, churches and monasteries, and also in aristocratic houses.An alternative method, replacing the lead came with copper foil, was invented in the 19th century, enabling creation of three-dimensional works, in addition to two dimensional ones to which the lead-came method is limited. The copper-foil artwork is commonly called Tiffany stained glass, even though there is a debate about whether John La Farge or Louis Comfort Tiffany invented this alternative to lead-came glasswork.Contents [hide]1 Overview 2 The process details 2.1 Designing on paper 2.2 Transferring the design to the glass 2.3 Cutting the glass 2.4 Grinding down the cut glass 3 Lead came 3.1 Stretching and cutting the lead-came strips 3.2 Assembling the lead and glass 3.3 Soldering the lead joints 3.4 Cementing the lead and glass panel 3.5 Adding reinforcement bars 4 Copper foiling 5 Tools and materials 5.1 General 5.2 For lead-came work 5.3 For copper-foil work 6 Other uses of the copper-foil technique 7 See also 8 External links  [edit]OverviewIn both lead-came and copper-foil glasswork a colorful design is created by the artist who joins pieces of stained glass panes that have been specially cut for the work.In the lead-came method the pieces of glass are embedded into the channels of the came, and then the joints between the came strips are soldered together.In the copper-foild method, the edges of the glass pieces are wrapped with copper adhesive tape, then soldered together along the whole length of the copper strip.[edit]The process details The steps in creation of Lead Came and Copper Foil Glasswork[edit]Designing on paperThe first step for both techniques is to create a design on paper. You can create your own designs, or use the large selection of design books and software available.The next step is to transfer the design to a piece of paper from which paper templates are cut out. Special pattern scissors are used, that cut out an extra thin strip of paper between the pieces, to compensate for the width of the lead-came or the copper-foil, that separates the pieces of glass in the final work. The scissors for lead-came work leave out a wider strip than for copper-foil.[edit]Transferring the design to the glassThere are two schools for this step: one practices gluing the cut paper to the glass before cutting it, the other holds the cut paper to the glass, and uses a paint pen to mark the glass around the paper edges. In a high output glass studio, professionals simply hold the pattern piece tight to the glass and carefully follow the edge of the paper with the cutter head. This can only be done well with practice.[edit]Cutting the glassIn this step the glass is scored using cutting oil and a steel or carbide wheel, making a tiny imperfection along which the glass is broken using glass plyers - when pressure is applied to the glass with the plyers, the glass snaps at the score line.[edit]Grinding down the cut glassThe glass pieces obtained from the previous step have sharp edges, and are not 100% accurate in their shape. The glazier can either account for this inaccuracy while glazing with lead came or implement an electric glass grinder with a diamond-coated grinding wheel to smooth-off the glass pieces, and to give them their accurate shape.

If it is an automatic, push down the park brake and move the selector from reverse to drive and back a couple of times. If if have a jerking and noisy transition, could be the rear axle. Nothing takes the place of a good inspection of the drive line. Support the rear axle on stands, shift the trans to neutral, apply the park brake. Try to turn the drive shaft as you notice the universal joints. No excess? Try to move the drive shaft up and down and side to side at the u-joint. No excess? Pull the rear cover on the differential and see what's going on in there. These differentials are a 7.5 in ring gear and will not take a lot of abuse. A reasonable upgrade for them is a posi carrier from a 4x4 Blazer or Jimmy. The carrier must be with the same axle ratio you have. I.E., a 2 carrier for a 2.73 or a 3 carrier for a 3.73. Unless you get the ring and pinion with the carrier. Next up would be an aftermarket carrier and ring and pinion gears. Next would be a stronger aftermarket differential, if you are really going to thrash it. Deep pockets for this one. Don't forget bearings and seals for the repair."

If so, you might be able to see what's causing the jam or at least where it is. You can try using a small object as a prybar by wedging it behind the drawer and prying outward gently to free it. If there is something in the drawer that is getting caught against the front lip of the cabinet, try using your hand if there is enough clearance or the spatula if not, to pry downward on whatever is causing the jam and slide the drawer out.If you manage to get the drawer free and it is caused by sticking/swelling, rub some paraffin or candle wax along the area where the sticking occurs. It will help next time you face this problem."

If your load was extra heavy, dip half out and put it in the bucket. Now flush. Deposit the bucket's contents into the bowl and flush again.Sort of like a NASA launch. To deal with a heavy load you must approach the problem in more than one stage.Another approach might be to purchase some teflon solution and apply it to the interior of the bowl just before release. Especially if your plop is particularly dry that day.I hesitate to recommend purchasing a pressure-assisted commode because a massive blockage in the downstream drainage pipe could result in a nasty blowback in the throneroom.

The mice need a winter place, but there seems to be a direct conduit to the same built-in cupboard. If I nail a can lid oven what may be their door into the cupboard, won't they just chew another door? I have searched and cannot locate their entrance from outside.","First answer was a good one. Pack all entry holes with steel wool IF you cannot properly repair the holes. A tin can lid works well also. Mice don't like metal.It sounds as if Momma was already there inside somewhere and gave birth. 8 in 3 days suggests a new and hungry family or an infestation which will only grow. Do you have an attic? If so, bait it with traps. Small chunks of Snickers works great as bait on the trap. Put traps all over attic for three days, clean them, leave them out for 3-5 days and reset them for another 3 days. Do this until all mice are gone. If you have a crawl space under your house use the same routine. as for the attic.Check everything outside that is near and/or touching your house - even tree/bush limbs. Mice can climb anything - amazing little creatures - so look at all possibilities.If you cannot stand to use traps and clean up the aftermath then there are some great dehydration poisons on the market. Dehydration works from the inside out. Ingested, mice usually search for water, thus leaving their den. Reaction however drys them out leaving just the dry remains intact and easy to dispose of.

Otherwise a lot of scraping is in your future.The hardest part is to get off the old laminate and any cement underneath it. If it is loose try sliding a paint scraper under it and prying up gradually. If not tap the scraper under the edging and try to get that off first with prying. Then start on the top sheet of laminate and slip the scraper under it and pry it. Repeat until all the laminate is off. Next look at the cement left on the plywood surface. Clean it off with a sanding block of about 200 grit.When cement is gone and laminate is in the dumpster, just get the new laminate, new contact cement, roller, some newspapers, and  either a router or a laminate trimmer. Just follow the application directions for the new laminate (with the most important being that wherever you put it down it is going to want to stick)."

3579,95414,how can i open my car door when I forgot the keys inside? ,"Hey Jessie! Listen to Loh. He/She just gave you the best advice. I also tried that that same technique a few weeks back, and it does work. So don't break the window or any of that other stuff. If you do have an extra set of keys at home, just call some one there. Hold your cell phone up to the lock on the door, and have the person at home hit the unlock button. It works, it did for me. I don't know who thought of this, but they were smart to share it with me, and looks like LOH also heard about it. So now it's your turn to pass it on. If it doesn't work on the first attempt, don't give up.Hugs Texas girl"

3585,46515,How do i replace the fan belt on a washing machine? Its too tight to go on!? ,"The drive belt (or belts) of a washing machine may become worn or damaged, causing noisy operation or stopping the washer entirely. A damaged drive belt is easy to replace. Remove the back panel of the washer to gain access to the belt. To remove the belt:Step 1: Loosen the bolt on the motor bracket and move the motor to put slack in the belt.Step 2: Remove the old belt and stretch a new one into place on the pulleys.Step 3: To put tension on the new belt, use a hammer handle or a short pry bar to push the motor into position while you tighten the bolt in the adjustable bracket. The belt should have about 1/2 inch deflection when you press on it at the center point, midway between the pulleys. If the belt is too loose, it will slip on the pulleys, causing the machine to malfunction. If the belt is too tight, it will wear very quickly and will probably become so hot that it will start to smoke or smell.Loose pulleys can also cause problems. Most pulleys are fastened to shafts with setscrews around the hub of the pulley. These screws must be tight or else the pulley or belt will slip. The resulting malfunction may seem to be caused by a faulty motor, but it can be corrected by tightening the pulleys and adjusting the belt. For this reason, always check the belts and pulleys before working on the motor."

3595,86901,How to stop 1997 grand voyager squeaky brakes? ,"If you've had new brake pads fitted, they can squeak while they are bedding in -- especially if they are sintered metal pads. This is normal and don't worry about it; the squeal will go away pretty soon when the pads are fully bedded in. (With race cars, they bed in several sets of pads during practice, and then they use the bedded in sets during a race. Not because they're worried about squeal but because bedded pads give slightly better performance -- and also they will know if any are duds that might disintegrate under full braking load. It happens...)You can fit ceramic-compound pads if you want. This will reduce the squeal.If you haven't had the brakes done for a while and they're squeaking really loud, most likely you have pads worn down to the metal and they're rubbing on the disk rotors. This is very bad news, because you are ruining the rotors and they're expensive -- and also the car won't stop as well as it should (until, that is, the things overheat and weld the pads to the rotors). You can also crack and/or warp the rotors if your pads are shot. The pads help to absorb heat and if they're too thin, the rotors get too hot.Take a look and see if you've still got brake material on the pads. If not, get them changed pronto (and probably the rotors will need to be machined as well). Always change both sides (ie both wheels) at the same time, even if one side is more worn than the others. This will keep your car's braking in balance.If you still have pads, they and/or the rotors have probably 'glazed'. They can be cleaned with special spray you can buy from any good auto accessories shop. DO NOT use gasoline to clean brakes, okay? Use only specialized brake cleaner.Check out the problem pronto or you may have a wreck. Seriously."

3598,141346,How to make a homemade carpet cleaner that really works? ,"Most carpet cleaners are little more than a little soap and water sold in fancy packages.  You will find purified water has tremendous cleaning power on its own.  I would suggest you try it alone for most fresh stains with a white paper towel.1) blot the stain or dirty area when fresh and remove as much of the stain with the paper towel.  Continue until the paper towel comes away clean even if the stain remains.2) Wet the area lightly and continue the process, until the paper towel comes away clean or the stain is gone.3) Mild soap and water with the clean paper towel.If you cannot get the stain out there is a tool called a cookie cutter that can patch an area of carpet.  Take carpet out of the closet corner (where it can't be seen) and replace it in the cookie cut area.  You are swapping the areas and most anyone can do this."

There's a valve on the side that one ""opens,"" meaning that one turns is to open it and turns it to close it.

3641,107530,how do i fix my schwinn scooter it says its charged and does not charge? ,"If the battery is showing fully charged from the charger but runs out quickly or does not charge at all, I would suspect a bad battery.  Take a multimeter and read voltage (Make sure the meter is set to DC!).  No matter the charge on the battery the voltage should remain the same... to check the charger, put the battery in series with the charger/meter( this time turn the meter to Ampere setting 10A max first - if you get nothing, then you can adjust to the mA setting) and you should get a corresponding reading to the manufactures specs.NiCd (Nickle Cadnium) and Li-Ion (Lithium Ion) have dissimilar characteristics on charging rituals...e.g.  NiCads like to be FULLY discharged before recharging - this lengthens the life of the battery while if you truly discharge a Li-Ion, you'll probably never be able to use it again.Also, schwinn products might be sold at walmart.  Or where ever you may purchase another battery save the receipt, and take the bad one back.good luck"

3661,30315,how do you bleed the boiler? ,"To properly bleed a boiler takes time and Patience. Your boiler should have an auto fill valve to let water in. Hopefully you also have boiler drains on each zone. These drains will have a connection to hook up a garden hose. Direct the garden hose to a drain in the floor, or somewhere that will get rid of the water. Caution, this water is not only hot(180-200 Degrees) but can be very black as well, so choose carefully were you drain to.Turn one of your t-stats up so the zone you are working on comes on, you can feel the hot water by placing your hand on the pipe, again be care full, it is very hot. if the zone is open but not flowing, slowly opening the drain should push the air lock through. do not open or drain the zone to quick, you do not want to let the boiler go dry, bad things happen then. When you feel the hot water come back to the boiler through the pipe you know you have flow. You can hear the air in the pipes as it circulates and open the drain slowly to purge the air out. You need to do this to each and every zone in the system.It is advisable to have an experienced HVAC tech. do this if you are not comfortable, and watch him, ask questions. This is your system, you should know how and why it works. Good luck."

3686,70051,how do you install car headlights with relay? ,"Here's what I found on wikiHow.com. This should work for all cars and trucks.Before getting started, you will need these things:Car Head Lights Wire Electrical Tape Relay (see step 2 for info!) Light Bulbs Switch Fuses Mounting Brackets Hardware to attached brackets and lights. Wire Strippers Wire Nuts. If you are replacing existing lights, skip steps 4-10. 1.Purchase needed materials (listed at bottom of page). If replacing existing units, see tips. 2. Remove the lights from the box and check their amp rating. Get a switch of suitable rating. If a switch of equal or higher ratings can't be found, you will need a relay (see below). 3. Use brackets to mount them in the desired location. 4. Locate a convient place in the vehicle to mount the switch for the lights. 5. Mount the switch in the vehicle. 6. Locate a source of power under the hood that does not directly attach the wires to the battery. (One some vehicles, the headlight circuit may do.) 7. If you found a switch of the needed rating above, connect as follows: source to switch, switch to lights, lights to source. Skip to Step 11. 8. Mount the relay somewhere under the hood. 9. Attach the Light circuit to the ""Load"" side of the relay (some relays may call this something else). Run wire from power source's Hot supply to one of the relays load terminals. Connect the relays other load terminal to the light closet to it. Connect the remaining connection on the light to one of the connections on the other light. Connect second lights remaining connection to the negative side of the power source. 10. Connect the switch. Run wire from a power source to one of the ""Control"" termainals on the relay. Connect the other termainal to the switch. Connect the remaining switch termainal to the negative of the power source. 11. Install bulbs. 12. Start car and test. If selected sources fuse blows, replace and try connecting to another source. 13. If they work, proceed. If not check connections. 14. Cover all joints with electrical tape to ensure water tightness. 15. Close hood and use. Warnings :Electrocution hazard.

3699,59480,How do I snake wire through an existing wall? ,"Purchase a short wire fish from Lowes or Home Depot (~$20).  Greenlee is a good brand.  Get a short one, 25' or smaller, for this application.  Drill small hole ( 1/2"" diameter ) at top, where your speaker will go.  Do in a spot where there are no studs behind the hole.  Figure this out with a stud finder (~$10) or just knock on the drywall lightly and listen to the pitch difference as you move horizontally along the wall.  You want the hollow sounding knock to avoid contention with a stud.  DIRECTLY below this hole, drill another that will be slightly larger... maybe 3/4"".   For bonus points, you might consider pulling back the baseboard molding so you can make your hole behind it (and thereby conceal the hold when replacing the molding).Roll out enough of the wire fish to span the distance between the holes (plus about a foot) and feed it into the upper one.  Curl the end of a thin metal coat hanger to fit into the lower hole and use it to grab the end of the wire fish.  Pull it out into the room.Tape your spreaker wire on good and pull through from above.  If you live in an older house with plaster walls, this is going to be more of a mess.  I wouldn't advise doing it.Doing this procedure on an exterior wall will work okay, but will require pushing the wire fish a little harder so it finds its way through insulation.  Your hole on the bottom may need to be a little bigger in order to successfully grab the wire fish.Good luck."

The copper button moved out some, but how do I tell if it ""opened?""  Should I be able to see light through it at some points?","First off, if you drop the thermostat into boiling water that is at least 190 degrees, you should see the center disc move away from the outer disc.On a more realistic note, I doubt you have a bad thermostat.  What was your reason for replacement in the first place?  If the car wasn't overheating originally, more than likely you have an air pocket in the cooling system.  Many cars come with a bleeder somewhere in the cooling system that allows air to escape.  If you do not bleed the air out, you have a cavity with no coolant.  This expands at a different rate than the coolant and can cause some serious issues with the vehicle.  Please respond with more information about why you replaced the thermostat and what kind of car you have."

I have a good flow of gas to the fuel pump, but I think that may after sitting for a while, something might be stuck in the pump. How do I get it running?","Sounds like the gas has evaporated in the carburetor bowl.  When it evaporates it leaves a varnish film which will cover the jets and probably has the float needle stuck in it's jet.Do this:  Take the air filter off the carb, look down into the carb, take hold of the throttle linkage and move it to full throttle a couple of times.  You SHOULD see gas squirting into the throat of the carburetor.  If you don't it may still be the carb is stopped up, the fuel pump valves are stuck OR the gas filter is plugged up.   It is something that you will have to check.

The water is turned on. Push the rod down no more than an inch at the float end. Did the water run and try to fill the tank? if so you're almost done. Hold at the pivot and at the float end bend the rod up CAREFULLY a bit at a time (1/4 inch stages) and when there's enough water to flush ok, you're done. Look out for where the handle fits into the tank, keep at least 3/4 inch below that for water level. And the rise and fall of the float itself, and rod, should not hit or tangle in anything.Case 2 - you can move the float up and down, water starts to run, but doesn't finish filling up the tank. TRy this - there may be a screw at the short (pivot) ent of the float (ball) arm. try turning it (only a quarter turn) counterclockwise, then gently push and pull the arm down and up again. maybe the valve was stuck.case 3- the valve will have to be replaced, kits are available, and cost no more that $20-$25 (CDN so cheaper in the US) plus Rona/Revy can give you a free pamphlet that explains how to do it much better than the Chinese instructions sheet you might get in the actual kit. PS, buy a flex hose to replace the supply line, the solids (copper or plastic) are awful. Spend the extra five bucks.case4 - call a plumber - who will charge $75 to show up (if and when they do) , plus parts and labor. $200 might be getting away easy.  I'd say - check out Revy or the local public library first...;case4 - you dont have an arm based float - just a plastic column. Look at the bit on top, and see whare it sits relative to the level of water in the tank. give it a small poke down, does more water flow? Column style valvesa are almost always plastic, and here you will want to buy a replacement, installation is a half hour job and a good DIY project - these valves are even easier than the lever/float to install and adjust.Good Luck!

If the front left corner is higher or lower than the front right corner, or if the back left corner is higher or lower than the back right corner, it may be time for a new suspension.Remember to take uneven loads out of the car first (no heavy boxes in the passenger seat), and remember that most roads slope slightly toward the curb, so a difference of an inch or two is probably ok.Other ways: If, when you drive over a bad road or railroad tracks or other rough terrain, the car should not ""bottom out"" (you'll feel it) on its suspension if the car is not excessively loaded.Also, a bad suspension may cause the tires to move out of alignment, and they might start developing unusual tread wear patterns (all wear on the inside half or outside half of the tire, for example), and you'll be able to see it. There are other things that can cause this so this does not automatically point to the suspension."

There is this large rectangular heating section on the wall, the pilot box is at the bottom.","Do you know if the heater worked before you moved in??  Maybe it's been broke for a while.  If it did work and it looks to be in decent shape, then it's possible you aren't getting the match near the right place.  It's also possible that there may be another valve in the line, (actually there is supposed to be another valve), besides the saftety valve on the unit, that shuts off the gas to the thing completely.  That may be closed.   If it is, no amount of fooling around with the saftety valve is going to get it to light.   If you can find such a valve, it will usually have a red handle, or knob, that will be turned to a 90 degree angle, (crossways), to the pipe it's installed in.

When I'm going like 10-15mph it sounds like the back tires are going to fall right off.  Then when I hit a bump I hear a clanking noise coming from the back.  I was at a garage and they told me it was the barring and that it was $70.00 plus labor.  Is it something I could have a family member due for me or am I better off having a more experienced person work on it.,"If the bearing is bad enough, it can cause your tire to tip in the back and cause undue stress on your braking components as well as other things.  Let it go even longer and it could lock up the rear tire and tear alot of stuff up.It is easy to change however.   Check and see if your car has ABS or not as this will make a difference with the new bearing.DISC BrakesRemove tireRemove caliper, brake pads, caliper bracket, and rotorRemove dust cap and large nutRemove hub assy and discardInstall hub assyInstall nut and torque (approx 140-180 ft/lbs)Install dust capInstall rotor, caliper bracket, brake pads and caliperInstall tireDRUM brakesRemove tire and brake drumRemove dust cap and large nutRemove hub assy and discardInstall hub assyInstall nut and torque (approx 140-180 ft/lbs)Install dust capInstall brake drum and tire"

3749,9037,How to operate a craftsman 2550 pressure washer? ,"first you have 2 hoses to hookup- the water hose and the hose that came with your pressure washer- the water hose is simple to figure out- the pressure washer hose is easy too once you know how - most pressure washers have slide couplers on them - their usually brass and the either slide forward or back - u have male and female adapters and you insert accordingly - make sure your spray gun is hooked up also- turn your water on, make sure you have fuel in your machine.  If you look down beside your fuel tank you should see the choke, throttle, on/off swicth, and possibly a primer- if theres a primer there will be instructions as to how many times to push it - turn your on/off switch to the on position- choke your carberator, again there should be directions as to where the choke position is - but after that you are ready to go - pull the rope and when it starts take it out of the choke position- usually it'll crank but cut off b/c the choke is on but once you get it running all you have to do is decide on what tip u want to use- your spray gun will have a lock on it so you may want to apply it while you're inserting it in your gun --- something good to remember is that the wider the tip opening, the wider the spray field- wide spraying tips are used for applying or misting the object before you pressure wash it, be extremely careful with tips that have small openings b/c they can cause serious damage to whatever you are spraying- i recommend using your #2 or #3 tip  -- you'll develop a feel for the spray gun fairly easy and then you'll be able to decide how close or far back you need to stand from an object to be effective- also remember to wear safety glasses"

3760,138991,how to clean a car using household stuff? ,"The problem with any of the household soaps is they are made to attack grease, etc. and other substances and break it down. Which means any type of dish/laundry soap will attack the finish (shine) on your paint. Ever see a car with the clear coat gone bad? The owner probably used Joy dish soap time after time. I suppose a very light dose of a baby shampoo just enough to get suds wouldn`t do too much harm, but keep it light. On the interior rugs and uphol. again a very light watered down dish or laundry soap for dirt would be OK, use a brush and `rinse` with clear water. The dash and hard plastic parts (tires) maybe just a damp cloth to clean away dirt, and a very light coat of Pledge-type product? After applying wipe with dry clean cloth. It may however attract dust and remain greasy feeling, haven`t tried that one. Overall you would be amazed at what just a damp cloth will clean, and actually just clear water, a rag, elbow grease and a towel can clean a car."

Pressure tank is about 20 years old and I have never had any trouble out of it. It appears to have about 50 lbs. of pressure when checked with new tire gauge. Is there any way to see if it is working before I replace it? Please help.,"to correctly check your pressure tank you must first turn off the breaker/power to well .   Drain the tank by using the closet drain to the pressure tank. We install a water bib on the tank tee for this reason. Once you have drained all water  wiggle tank and see if it still has water in it. If it is heavy with water your bladder has developed a pinhole and the tank needs replaced. If bladder is good all water will leave tank.   NEXT using an airgauge check air in tank , it should be @ 28 lbs if your pressure switch is set to come on at 30lbs  . NEVER should they have 50lbs of air!   If you have a gauge on your tank tee and it is working correctly which they do fail fairly easy . You can find your cut in pressure by turning on power and refilling pressure tank. Once full turn on water somewhere and watch gauge on tee to see where the pressure switch kicks on and calls for water. You want to set your air pressure lower than the cut in pressure by at least 2 lbs. If you have any questions e-mail me and I will answer your questions. DO not listen to the previous answers.

3781,30824,"How do I remove the rotors off of a 2000 Pontiac Grand Am? I have the tires off already, but am having a hard time with the rest!!!","What ever you do, don't listen to FT.  Nor do you use a jackhammer.  Talk about trying to gain free points.Anyway what Dodgeman says is correct for the most part.  Remove the lower caliper bolt, using a screwdriver, push the piston back a little bit and swing the caliper up.  Slide the caliper from the bracket that holds it.  Hang the caliper with a cord or something, do not allow it to hang freely as this can damage the brake hose.Remove the caliper bracket and then remove the rotor, may need to smack it with a hammer to remove it.I use a grinding disc to clean the hub so there is no rust.  This helps to eliminate the chance of causing a pulsation in the rotor.  I also use a wire brush to clean the caliper bracket where the pads slide and use brake grease from NAPA to lube them up to allow the pads to slide.  Now is also a good time to push the piston back into the caliper.To re-install, place the rotor on the hub and install the caliper bracket and tighten down.  Install the brake pads correctly (I usually put a small amount of silicone grease on the back of the pads to reduce squealing).  Install the caliper and tighten.  Install the tire, snug the lug nuts in a star pattern and torque evenly to 100 ft/lbs.MAKE SURE TO PUMP THE BRAKES UP BEFORE DRIVING AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY WORK!!!"

3790,40607,How do you anchor wood or metal studs into concret floor? ,If you are framing or not you need to run a stud on the concrete where you intend to attach it. You drill holes through your (plate) the floor piece to match the holes you drill in the concrete with a masonry bit. You will need some (anchors) that fit the holes you drilled into the concrete. you hammer them in flush with the surface of the concrete. When you buy the anchors it's best to buy the masonry bit at the same time so the sizes are comparable. The anchors should be just about as large as the masonry bit but the should fit snug when tapped into the concrete floor. Then you lay your plate or stud over the sunken anchors. The holes should match up with the anchors providing that you drilled them with the plate in place thus marking your anchors position on the floor. Then your anchors come equipped with the Bolts that you run through the plate and into the concrete which now makes you hire-able in one construction trade. Good luck.

Not sure if I did any other damage internally to the motor but what is the best way to find out after I replace the belt?,"You can breathe a sigh of relief because your particular car's engine is NOT an interference engine, meaning the valves will NOT touch the pistons if it goes out of time. Anybody who posts, telling you otherwise, is full of S***. Even more good news is that it is also VERY easy to replace on your particular car if you are somewhat skilled. Any place you take it to, should not charge you any more than 3 hours of labour to do the repair. Any more than that, they are ripping you off. The belt itself, is also very inexpensive, even from the Ford dealer. Are you going to attempt to replace it yourself? If so, the sizes for the fasteners are 17mm for the engine mount fasteners, mostly 10mm for the splash guards underneath, as well as the fasteners that secure the hoses up top in the engine compartment,13mm for the belt tensioner bolt, 19mm for the crank pulley, and I think two 11 or 10mm nuts that hold the timing cover.

3820,20554,How do iI make a loud generator more quit? ,"Portable generators are noisy. If you have neighbors nearby or the noise is unbearable in your house here are some ideas. - Choose an operating location as far away as possible. Note that a larger gauge wire is needed to reduce voltage drop as line length increases. Reducing line loss is required to minimize power loss and to ensure maximum power is available to the house. Lights will flicker less when heavy loads are attached. - Change the exhaust system. Noise from the portable generator systems comes primarily from two sources, the engine block and the exhaust system.. With an air cooled engine there is little you can do about block noise. Some engines can have a larger muffler attached or make other changes to the exhaust system. Merely mounting exhaust pipe vertically will noticeably reduce noise. - Build a noise shielding enclosure. This could be as simple as a piece of plywood to reflect sound away from the house to a separate shed to hold the generator. Design your enclosure with safety in mind. Provide adequate air circulation and ventilation to prevent heat buildup and to remove carbon monoxide. - If the noise bothers your neighbors, invite them over for coffee or offer to run line to their home to power the freezer or a few lights. Talk to them before starting the engine, ask they let you know if the noise is bothersome before they phone the police or harbor any resentment. A little diplomacy can go a long way. - Last resort, shut off the engine or buy a quiet generator."

3868,18220,How to tell if your vehicles transmission is bad? I have a 1993 nissan pathfinder,"When Good Transmissions Go Bad By Heather Madigan & Carolyn MartellCarPrices.com  The word transmission conjures up dread, perhaps even fear. Especially when your mechanic starts to utter, ""I think your transmission is . . ."" Your brain is attacked violently by the image of your checkbook being sucked empty by a greedy vacuum. The money you had been saving to go on vacation, or to buy that new computer, ultimately will dwindle to nothing now that there is something wrong with your transmission.Instead of having to succumb every ounce of your savings to a mechanic, maybe you can diffuse some transmission problems before they set in. The solution is called preventive maintenance, and it comes highly recommended by manufacturers, dealers, mechanics and generally everybody who has a car or knows about them.The damage done to a transmission can be catastrophic to your lifestyle, at best. For one thing, while your car sits in the shop, you must get a ride wherever you want to go -- Grrr! And then there's that little matter of money: Rebuilding a transmission is estimated at around $2,150. That's some pretty major incentive to try to maintain the transmission as best you can.The basics are a good place to start. The transmission propels the car forward. It is a mechanism that transfers the power produced by the engine, ultimately to spin the wheels of the vehicle. The transmission operates under tremendous heat, therefore it is vital that the fluids are maintained and that extra caution is taken when driving in extreme conditions, such as harsh winter weather or hauling heavy loads. The transmission, however, can overheat by normal driving, pushing the fluid temperatures well beyond safe limits.According to the Automatic Transmission Rebuilds Association, overheating causes 90 percent of all transmission failures. Most of these can be blamed on worn-out fluid that should have been replaced. Check your transmission fluid level regularly, and actually smell it to find out if it has a burnt odor. If it does smell burnt, it needs to be changed. Refer to your car manual to find out specific mileage/time intervals to check and change the fluid, which varies from car to car. Every 30,000 to 50,000 miles is a good number to keep in mind. Performing this sooner will not hurt anything though.If there is a reddish leak under your vehicle, this could spell bad news. It's usually the automatic transmission fluid. It is vital at this point to check the fluid level more frequently. Whatever you do, do not allow that fluid to run low! The transmission will heat up, breaking down the fluid's ability to lubricate and cool. This will increase friction and heat, which will wear out the transmission prematurely. Use the transmission fluid that is recommended in the car manual or printed on the dipstick. Using the wrong type of fluid can affect the way the transmission shifts and feels, causing it to shift too harshly or slip under heavy loads.Getting the vehicle stuck in mud or snow can cause another potential hazard to the transmission -- as well as the whole vehicle, seeing as how it is stuck somewhere. It always is suggested that you dig your vehicle out or get towed vs. the alternative. And at one time or another, we all have seen -- or perhaps resorted to -- the jump-on-the-bumper method to gain traction to rock the vehicle free. This can shock the transmission more than it can handle, and internal parts can start to break.The life of any automobile is extended when it is taken care of properly. So, what if you do change the fluids and keep up on the fluid levels, and it still overheats? Remember, this is a machine and machines break. Do what you can to keep your transmission in good health by performing regularly scheduled maintenance checks. There isn't much more you can do other than hiding the vehicle in the garage, and that's no fun!"

However, we would like to know whether the contractor had used the correct epoxy coating. How can we test the mix?

3885,101418,How do i raise and lower the pressure in my hot water base board heating boiler's pipes? I have a 1983 Boiler in my house.  I tried bleeding the air from the system a few days ago.  I did so till water came out and now i think it makes more water dripping noise in the pipes than before?  I want to bleed more from the pipes but i'm not sure if i should add more water and if that will increase or decrees the water pressure to much.  Right now the water pressure is at 23 psi and when it's on it's about 30 psi,"The system is, or should be, self-regulating with regard to pressure and water supply.  I don't think you can affect this.  regardless of pressure, the system will circulate heated water by gravity and convection.  There should be a circulator that forces the hot water through the system and returns the cooled water to the heater.  If your system is that old, it could need flushing-something a heater tech should be called for- or the pipes might simply be clogged with corrosion or mineral deposits which would restrict the flow of water.  The ""dripping"" noises might be from expansion and contraction of the the pipes as hot or cold water is introduced.  What is your intent with regard to water pressure?"

Has anyone had this done to their wheels? also how much does  this usually run in the bay area?,"I've worked in a wheel manufacturing plant for over 2 years. They get the balance checked at the machining level. Then they get polished and powder coated. If a wheel is ""unbalancable"" it is not sent any farther through the process. I do not believe that a simple powder coat will throw off the balance of a wheel so much that it wouldn't be balancable after the fact. As stated in another answer, the tires have to be removed for the pc process, so it seems logical that they will get re-balanced when the pc process is complete. In the bay area, you can plan on it being expensive to pc any type of wheels. Call around, search the web, investigate prices on this before just shelling out big bucks!!!! In short...Powder Coating wheels will NOT affect your balance beyond drivability. Hope this helps you. Good luck!!!"

3922,73352,How can you move rainwater underground away from the house? ,"I'm not sure exactly what you mean but if you're talking about the rain water coming off your house, one way is to bury black drain tile underground and extend it several feet away from the house.  You can also connect some of the drain tile with a wye connector.  Drain tile is the black drain hose that is sold at major home supply stores.  If your yard is sloped, you can bury the drain tile so it drains away from the house in the low lying areas.  This is especially effective if you have downspouts that drain across a sidewalk.  You can bury the drain tile under the side walk and connect it directly to the vertical downspout.  One of the most effective ways to dig under a sidewalk is to use a garden hose and water pressure. They sell fittings that connect gutter to drain tile.  Drain tile is also relatively inexpensive."

3928,83772,How do you tell if your water tank is water logged and what are the symptoms of the water well pump if this oc ,"When the pump system is water logged, you have lost the capacity in the tank itself. One way to check it is look for a ""water line"" on the tank if it is a metal tank. If the ater is cold enough, you will see condensation form at the level of the water. If it is a fiberglass tank, let the pump pump up to pressure and shut off. Make sure nothing is using water in the house or building. Get a 5 gallon bucket and put it under a faucet and open the faucet. Count the gallons it takes before the pump comes back on. If the pump comes on immediately, the system is definitely water logged. Most tanks have a 5 to 20 gallon drawn down gallons, or the gallons that it puts out before the pump comes back on. To ""un-water log"" the tank, drain the tank down all the way and fill it back up. The pump should add air to the tank as it pumps. The is also some kind of air volumn control either on the tank or in the well piping. Make sure it is working properly and letting air out or adding air, depending on the style of control. Hope this helps! Good luck!"

3935,108314,How do I get oil out of my vehicle coolant system? Vauxhall Omega 2.5 V6 oil cooler failure in coolant system.,"You need to what we call backflush or reverse the flow of the coolant in the system. as the engine gets hotter ther thermostat located usually near the top of the engine will open and allow coolant to flow to the radiator where it then falls through the channels and the mving air passing through the radiator cools it, so your coolant flows in this direction to remove impurities you have to reverse the flow.  Remove the thermostat and then force water the opposite way round the system including the radiator, you can add a flushing compound but the most important thing is to continue witth this until you get clear water, when finished refit the thermostat and new gasket/seal if it has one and then add the correct amount of antifreeze and top off with water til it reaches the level required, run vehicle with the heater on hot until normal operating temp is reached and then very very carefully using a rag gently remove the pressure cap to check the level, if it is low use warm water to top it up as this will avoid a coolant shock to any of the alloy components and gaskets in the engine.  It is a time consuming process taking on average 40 mins to complete successfully"

3942,47669,How would you preserve and paint and preserve a squirrel cage circulating fan for a furnace? The blades are rusty looking.   I was thinking about sanding them or using maybe a tube brush on them to remove the rust and then ragging on a primer and then enameling them.  Any suggestions?,"There's absolutely no reason not to refinish and continue to use it, provided the rust isn't excessive to the point that blades are deteriorating.  Paint on some rust gel, the chemical reaction turns the rust into a stable material.  You can paint it on without removing the blades probably.  Follow directions on the gel.  You'll probably have to hose the cage off as a last step.  Then get a good quality primer in a spray can - not the cheapest, a good quality.  Spray it and get good coverage.  You could stop there, without having to add any other paint.  I'd prime it with a gray color and be done with it.  The weight from the paint will be very much negligible and won't affect the spinning action.  Also, I'd give it a good oiling, maybe even use grease vs. oil, to ensure a smooth spinning operation.  If you use grease, you may improve the operation of the cage better than when it was brand new.Good luck!"

3952,114056,"How do you remove someone elses paint from your car? My friend has white 2006 mustang gt. It is in excellent condition. The other day after being parked at the gym he noticed that there was a little bit of red paint on his bumper. There is no damage to the bumper at all, no scratches either. Just looks like someone bumped up against it and left some of their paint. My question is what is the best way to remove it without damaging his paint.","you can use a lot of products out there to remove paint. some of it is designed to remove it and yet others can damage it if used wrong.  Yes you could buff it out but try using a little laquer thinner on a rag. Don't rub real hard or you can damage the paint under it. Since the paint from the other car is on top of the wax and clearcoat it isn't really stuck on as hard as the paint on your car. I have also used easy off oven cleaner to remove paint off of vehicles that have been bumped or had lettering put on the sides for commercial vehicles. Just spray it on and let it sit for a few minutes then wipe clean. make sure it is not cold when you do this as the warmer it is the faster and better it will work. Also no matter what you use insure that you give the area a good waxing before you let the car sit out in the weather as any cleaner that you use will remove or damage the wax coating as well. If you have scratches in your paint after you remove the unwanted persons paint then you can get touch up paint at your local body shop or parts store. Touch up the paint prior to waxing or it won't stick. I have over 5 years body shop experiance and have had to remove tons of paint off cars including graffitti spray painted onto vehicles. Believe me ""Easy Off oven cleaner"" does work for the more tougher jobs.  For minor jobs try graffiti remover or goof off. In some cases just ""WD40"" will work.  Good luck."

What should we use to clean it that will kill the black mold and any other kinds of molds or mildew that might be lurking there.,"Bleach will not strictly KILL it. If it happens to get to walls, removal of the drywall is the best step.   I recently replaced 11,000 sq. ft. of flood damaged drywall attacked by black mold, after the management attempted bleach.   Black mold attacks absorbent, welcoming surfaces. In the case of drywall, black mold only attacks the paper and paint, not the gypsum. In the case of carpet, wood, and concrete,it will continue to manifest, unless the carpet is removed, wood is removed, and concrete is sealed,,,then de humidifying is a constant.Rev. Steven"
3959,8612,how to change the fuel filter on a ML430? ,"You do not need to remove the back seat. You have to remove the back wheel and the plastic innner wheel well though. It may be hard to manuver in the small space were the filter is if you have large hands. You will need to depress the tabs on the lines where they connect to the filter. There are 2 of them on each line that are 180 degrees from each other. Chances are you have new lines that came with the filter. They made a change in the filter to a longer one and the lines need to be used to fit it. Make sure you connect the lines to the filter before setting it in place.  After filter is in place. Turn the ignition on and off about 6 times to prime the new filter. If you don't and try to start it, it will trip an engine code. The code is no big deal if you do trip it but you need a special tool to reset the computer."

3976,129397,"How do I stop my bathroom pipes from making a loud trembling sound? It started when I was using the sink in my batroom to wash my hands. I couldn't stop it, my boyfriend came in and thought to flush the toilet. Immediately the sound went away. As the tank started to fill it stayed quiet. Once it was full, the noise started again. So I kept having to flush the toilet to avoid having the whole place rumble and make strange noises. My boyfriend thought to keep the bathtub tap slightly on. This is a waste of water just to prevent weird rumbling noises, what on earth is wrong with my pipes, this never has happened before?","Every outlet in the building needs to be opened up to allow the trapped air out of the lines.  Until you do this, it will continue to make the groaning noise.  Does it make a banging noise when you suddenly shut off the tap?  If it does, talk to a plumber type dude at Lowes, or a hardware store, and ask about a valve that stops this from happening.  You might install one of these valves, and it will resolve the problem.  I have seen some stranger things happen.  Mybe you could call ghost busters lol?  I hope this help you in some way.  Good Luck!!!Part 2:You are right, if the water was off because of the landslide, and the water is brown, then I would say there is a lot of air in the lines coming from the supply.  Until all this air works its way out of the system, you will have noise.  I hate to tell you this as I know you wanted to hear something more positive, but it sounds like the whole system has air in it.  Sometimes the water can have a lot of air in it and it will take on a brown tint.  Try this; run some water into a clear glass, and let it set for an hour or two, and see if the water clears up.  Also; put some in a white tea cup, and let it set for an hour.  If its mud in the water the cup will have brown tint on the white glass that you can wipe off with a paper towel.  Usually when there is one there is the other.  If the clear glass of water gets clear after a while, then it may be air instead of dirt.  You can also run some through a coffee filter, and see what it looks like.  It can take some time for it to go away if it is that much air in the system.  Ask your neighbors if they are having the same kind of problem.  I'll bet they are.Good Luck!!!"

3978,40724,how to time a 73 pontiac 350? ,"Remove the #1 spark plug on the drivers side in the front of motor.  With the distributor cap off bump the starter to determine which way the rotor turns.  Clean the timing marks and indicator on the harmonic balancer and timing chain cover.  Make a mark at 8 degrees BTC (before top dead center) or which ever the tag on the vehicle says to time it on.  It will be from 5-10 degrees BTC.  Make another mark on the balancer that is 0 degrees or (Top Dead Center) TDC.  While someone else bumps the starter over, cover the #1 plug hole with your thumb until it blows your finger off.  At this point you want to turn off the ignition switch and turn the engine (by hand) in whichever direction it takes to bring it to TDC or 0 degrees.  On the top of the intake you will find the firing order.  Make a note of this order, and check later on.  Your distributor should be pointing at or just before the number one plug wire on the cap.  This should be with the rotor pointing towards the front of the engine.  If it is out of place you need to remove the distributor, turn it to where its hitting the notch that is before the #1 on the cap.  Remember it wil go down more when it goes into the oil pump.  You can use a long screwdriver to turn the oil pump to where the distributor goes all the way down.  With it all the way down, you should be able to turn the distributor and make the rotor point some on both sides of the #1 on the cap.  If It does not do this, then you need to move to another slot until it will sweep both before and after the #1 on the cap.  This will align your vacuum chamber to where it doesn't hit something when you are done.  Turn the distributor till it is just a few degrees before the #1 on the cap, and the distributor is down all the way in the oil pump.  Put the hold down on, and tighten the bolt to where you can turn the distributor but with a little effort to do so.  Don't forget to put the gasket under the distributor or it will leak oil.  Now check the firing order in the direction the rotor turns.  Starting in the front of the engine toward the headlights on the drivers side, the #1 will be the first one.  The second one on that same side will be #3, and #5 and #7.  From front to back on the other side of the engine it will be #2, and #4, and #6, and #8.  After you have checked the firing order, you are now ready to start the engine.  Have something like a wet blanket or towel handy in case you are out a notch and it backfires through the carburetor, as this can make a fire.  If it doesn't start right away, you are in the wrong notch, and will have to remove the distributor and start over.  Remove the #1 plug, get it on the compression stroke, see if the rotor is point at or just before the #1 plug wire on the cap.  If you have it there then you are in the correct notch.  It is easy to get off one notch and this can be a pain to get right, but you should be able to fire the engine without grinding on it.  I should start right up, and run pretty good.  Now use a timing light when you get the engine warmed up to operating temperature and the idle speed at about 750-800 RPM.  Plug the vacuum hose that goes to the distributor, and adjust the timing to spec's, or about 8-10 degrees BTC.  Glad I could help.  Good Luck!!!"
3979,25022,How to remove top of bathroom sink hot tap? I had some helpful advice about my previous enquiry - 'No water coming out of hot tap in bathroom sink' - http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AlwO2n3yn4JZ58DlwrRoi3UgBgx.?qid=20061113071510AAwKOj3I know this is stupid but I can't remove the very top of the tap to inspect it to see if it needs a new washer.

3995,101634,How does the 'boiler' work to heat the house? I have the timer set to come on 3  times a day. Is the gas supposed to come on in between these times? (I dont wanna make the house explode!) I have never seen a boiler before I came to England. Help?,"Certainly you have boiled water in a teapot, a boiler is much the same.First it has a fuel/heat source which in your case is gas.The boiler has electrionics that open the gas valve to allow gas to the burners for a period of time.  During that short period of time there is a ignitor that sparks and lights the gas much like on your stove.  When the temperature in the house matches what the thermostat is set at the gas shuts off. (no real need to worry about the gas blowing up your house)Back to the teapot, you have put water in the teapot, there is water in your boiler, normally this water level is controled by a float which turns on the water when the level gets low and shuts off when the water gets to a normal level.If the water is too low the boiler will not start up as a safety feature to keep the boiler from burning up, like the teapot would do if you put it on the stove without water.After the water in the boiler starts boiling and getting hotter it creates steam.  You see this steam in your teapot coming out the spout.This steam is sent throught a series of pipes to the heaters throughout the house.  These heaters are normally cast iron and heavy, the steam enters the top of these heaters and cools back down to water which a pipe at the bottom of the heater sends the water back into the boiler, so normally unless you have valve packing leaking or joints leaking you need very little make-up water from your well or city.An additional note, this is a fairly quiet system, the only way sometimes to tell it is on is feeling the heater.In the Spring or Summer when the boiler is off and cool, drian the boiler and refill a couple of times to get the sludge out of the bottom to increase the effiency of it."

Is there a way to repair this?,"I've been in the ""business for 25 years"" and have installed hundreds of square feet of this. The former installer did not leave the proper space in the installation process, there should have been a gap left under the trim mold on the sides for expansion.

Is the floor glued down, this is the big question, if it is, Ooops! I don't know what you can do and keep the looks.

4035,67412,how do i change the oil on my fiesta 1.1 lx? ,"Since nobody wants to tell you what to do...I will. Get an oil drain pan. Get 4to 5 quarts of oil and the recommended oil filter. Put the drain pan under the car directly under the oil pan drain plug. Use a six point socket or wrench, And an oil filter wrench that fits your cars oil filter. The six point ones help keep you from stripping the bolt head. If it seems tight bump the wrench in the direction you need to go.with your hand. A bump breaks free bolts that you can't get loose a lot easier. Try not to drop the drain bolt in the drain pan unless you get one that has a catch screen designed to keep things from falling into the oil drain pan. Once the oil has drained. Reinstall the drain plug. Make sure if it has a gasket on it that the gasket is there when you reinstall it... It can be over looked if the gasket fell off the plug..Next. Remove oil filter using the oil filter wrench. Unscrew it and let it drain in the pan. Then physically look at the filter and make sure the rubber gasket is still on the old filter. It is possible for the filter to come off,and the o ring gasket to stay stuck on the engine... This is a big no no. Because if you screw the new filter on with the old gasket in place it's not gonna seal and make a huge mess when you start your car. Now that you know that you don't have the old gasket still on, take the new filter and put a light film of oil on the gasket of the new filter.... You can use new or old oil to put on the gasket..It doesn't matter. Screw new filter on as tight as you can by hand. Then take your filter wrench"" and I only say this because your a femal and may not have the hand strenth to get it tight enough with out the tool. And tighten it another1/4 to 1/2 turn. Then just fill it up with oil. Put in 3 quarts and check the dipstick. Then just keep adding oil till the dipstick finally is on the full mark. Then start your vehicle. look under it and see if you have any leaks.... Turn the car off and wait 1 to 2 mins and check the level again. Then just fill as needed till oil on the dipstick where it should be and your done. I was a little too detailed but that's because I'm guessing you've never changed oil in anything before by yourself"

I've had to do this twice with stubborn hayward cart filters and had to use a different approach both times. Your best bet is to get a tech in. There's just too many ""ifs"" here to suggest one method over another and ideally you want to start with what may work with the least damage, first. No telling what that is unless you post a picture of it or have someone actually look at it. If you have room and the nut isn't engaged fully, myself, I'd be cutting off the plastic surrounding the brass for both a better look and to see if it's worth a shot at cutting the brass threading off being careful not to ding up the rod threads.

Remove the wheel speed sensor electrical connector from the bracket, if equipped. Remove the front wheel drive shaft nut. Insert a drift or flat-bladed tool into the caliper and rotor to prevent from turning. Remove the brake rotor. (Removing the dront driveshaft nut is going to be the hardest part of the repair.  It is a large nut - 36mm if I remember correctly - and torqued to over 140 ft lbs) Use 3 wheel nuts in order to attach the J 42129 to the wheel bearing/hub.Use the J 42129 in order to push the wheel drive shaft out of the wheel bearing/hub. (often times the drive shaft will push out of the hub with only hand pressure - the older and more rust on it, the more likely you are to need the tool to overcome the rust) Remove and DISCARD the wheel bearing/hub bolts. Remove the J 42129 from the hub. Important: Ensure that the wheel drive shaft outer seal/boot is not damaged. Remove the wheel bearing/hub and splash shield-noting the position of the shield for re-installation. Installation ProcedureInstall the wheel bearing/hub with the splash shield as noted during removal.Caution: These fasteners MUST be replaced with new fasteners anytime they become loose or are removed. Failure to replace these fasteners after they become loose or are removed may cause loss of vehicle control and personal injury.Install NEW wheel bearing/hub bolts. Tighten Tighten the NEW wheel bearing/hub bolts to 130 N·m (96 lb ft).Install the brake rotor and caliper.Install the front wheel drive shaft nut. Insert a drift on a flat-bladed tool into caliper and rotor to prevent the rotor from turning.

Its in a carport.,"Instructions STEP 1: Spread a thick layer of fresh sawdust or kitty litter over the grease to absorb excess grease or oil on the surface. STEP 2: Allow the sawdust or kitty litter to sit for a day or two. STEP 3: Gently sweep away the dirty sawdust or kitty litter. STEP 4: Pour dry cement over the entire dried grease spot. STEP 5: Allow the cement to sit for a day or two. STEP 6: Gently sweep away the dirty cement. STEP 7: Gather dirty cement in a bag and throw it away. Do not allow the dirty dry cement to go down the sewer. Tips & Warnings The kitty litter and sawdust soak up grease on the surface, whereas the dry cement actually absorbs the stain out of the driveway. For best results, clean up grease stains as soon as they happen. Avoid further staining by using large automotive drip pans for vehicles that leak. Make sure the forecast is clear for the days you'll be using dry cement on the grease spots if they are outdoors. Dry cement and water will create hardened concrete."

Your house's problem is in the ducting and dampers.  I suspect a few breaks (disconnected branch ducts).Start at the heater and trace the duct runs, test each damper to make sure they are open, look for ""blowholes"" or disconnected ducts.  Connect the disconnected, cover the holes (sheet metal patch pieces, screws and seal edges with duct tape), open the dampers.If you do all that and still have trouble, call in a Heating & Ventilating contractor.  Tell him to give you a quote for duct cleaning.  (They have brushes on a wound cable something like a dry Roto-Rooter.)  What I suspect, at that point, is that something large has gotten inside a duct (someone dropped clothes down a floor register or an animal crawled in there).  The HV contractor will find it and you'll have cleaner air circulating in the house.The typical house should have the ducts cleaned every 5 years for the sake of Indoor Air Quality."

Start with an 80 or 100 grit and work your way up to a 400 depending on how fine you want the finish to be.  Chemical is the easiest but most hazardous to you and the environment.  just follow the directions on the stripper you select.  A heat gun is the trickiest to use.  Inpatients can lead to scorching of the wood or worse a fire.  Go slow and do not over heat the work.
4086,76399,how do i change the front indicator bulb on a 2005 renault megane? ,"With difficulty.The official access mentioned in the handbook is via a removable panel in the front wheel-arch liner. It will make more sense if you look at the diagrams in the handbook before starting.Put the steering on almost full lock towards the opposite side from the indicator you need to access (not quite full lock, switching the engine off on full lock can cause problems with the electric steering lock disengagement next time you try to start).This allows you to see the oval-shaped access panel, which slides to one side and removes.Carefully reach through the hole left by removing the access panel, locate the rear of the indicator bulb-holder, and carefully twist to remove. It should now be possible to bring the bulb-holder out through the access hole to change the bulb.I believe most dealers actually don't use this method, and instead remove the whole headlamp unit forwards, but I think this requires removal of some of the fastenings for the front bumper fascia.Have a read of some of the articles on the owners forum for more details http://www.meganeownersclub.co.uk/"

You may want to talk to the manufacturer before you do anything.  They may be able to offer the best suggestions for your windows.The problem has to do with relative humidity, the temperature inside your house and the temperature outside your house.Several conditions can increase condensation problems. If you close drapes over windows, this can cause the glass temperature and the temperature of the air between the drape and the glass to become cooler, making condensation more likely.  If the thermostat setting is dropped substantially at night, this will cause an increase in relative humidity and may increase condensation. This condensation should vanish once the temperature rises in the morning.  Cooking with uncovered pots, taking long showers, and poor ventilation overall all add to the humidity in your house.These sites offer some suggestions.  Good luck with getting the problem solved."

4092,64242,"how do i prime my oil burner/furnace? i recently ran out of oil in my oil burner/furnace, and now that the thing is full again it won't turn back on. i've already tried bleeding the thing and that doesn't work. where i live it is very cold and i need help fast!!!","First, if you ran out of oil it is possible you MAY have drawn some sludge into the line and clogged the orifice (nozzle) in the burner. It must be cleaned or replaced. Unless you're a good mechanic AND you know what you're doing let a serviceman do it.MORE  LIKELY,  if you did draw sludge from your tank into the supply line it may very well have 'gummed up' the in-line filter (if you have one) - most systems do. You MAY have to replace the filter element and,  if you do replace it,  fill the canister and filter assembly with fuel oil before reassembling it. This is the best way to prime the line and it saves a lot of bleeding time and by not having the canister filled you may not be able to completely bleed the system. Sounds like either a clogged filter (most likely) or a clogged nozzle(orifice) or BOTH!  One other thing - if you know when your oil deliveries are scheduled make an effort to have someone home and have them turn off the emergency shut-off switch (usually a red wallplate) prior to the delivery. Leave it off for 2 hours or so before turning it back on. The reason? When oil is pumped into the tank it stirs up the 'gunk and junk' which has settled to the bottom of the tank and this 'stuff' stays suspended in the oil for some time after the delivery. By not running the oil burner for several hours you give the 'gunk' a chance to settle back to the bottom of the tank and not be pulled into the supply line where it does its dirty deeds.Good luck!"

4114,84149,How do I remove super glue from kitchen counter? I have tried nail polish remover and it does not work.? ,"The active ingredient in almost every Nail Polsih Remover is acetone, it has a very low vapor pressure and so it evaporates almost instantly from the surface to which it is applied.  A better solvent for this task is Methyl Ethyl Ketone (MEK), it has a higher vapor pressure than the Acetone so it works on the Cyanoacrylate (super glue) for a longer period of time.  If the countertop that you spilled the CA (Cyanoacrylate) on is a solid surface countertop like Corian you might have problems since it is another acrylic resin that could be dissolved by the MEK.  For the sake of Saving possibly thousands of $'s, please, please, please test the MEK on an inconspicuos area first.  If it dissolves the countertop material, follow the other suggestion and degrade the CA by placing a terry cloth rag over the top of the spill and pouring hot (not boiling) water over it.

4120,13055,"how to fix a leak in a 2"" Pvc pipe arround a swiming pool without a trench? The trouble is in the return circuit to the pool","You don't.There are two options. 1/ replace the entire line ( requires a lot of digging)2/ Have a pool pro pressure test the line. He can do a leak location during the test and tell you within 6 inches or so where the leak is located. Even under 6 inches of concrete and 3 feet down. (less digging and cheaper than replacing the entire line) Then it's just a matter of digging out an area one man can work in, down to the break and inserting a coupling in the line. Typically, the hole in the deck can be just 2 feet by 2 feet in most cases and easily patched when the repair is done. The colour won't match if this is a concrete deck , I'm afraid, but there's no getting around that. Typically, the pressure test and leak location costs anywhere between 50 - 100 dollars depending on how long it takes them due to the nature of the pool and it's equipment. The actual repair, you could do yourself, but it's back breaking, requires working in a tight space, be good with basic hand tools and have a spotter ready to pull you out if you initiate a cave in with your head down that hole. If you get someone in to do the repair, the rate usually starts at about 200 dollars (unless it's a line just under dirt) and can easily top 600 if it's in a bad spot. If there's no way you want to cut the deck (like a stamped coloured concrete deck) then tunneling, when the leak is located is an option, but VERY expensive. I've dug a 12 foot one once under a garden that couldn't be disturbed to the leak and the bill came to over 1200 dollars."

I need to put up new baseboards, but don't have much to nail them to.","You can buy some sheetrock at a lumber yard or home improvement center (or maybe even pick up some free scraps). Cut it with a utility knife to size and screw pieces in place with dry wall screws to replace the crumbled plaster. You may have to remove more plaster to expose the studs, which are the best places to screw the sheetrock to (I'm assuming you are talking about lath (wooden strips) and plaster in your wall; if what's crumbling is sheetrock (hard plaster between two sheets of paper), then just cut out the bad parts with a utility knife, back to a stud. After you've screwed on the new sheetrock pieces, use joint compound to plaster up the gaps. If you've just got small holes, you can just use joint compound to fill them up. You could also just apply joint compound over big areas of lath, but I find for larger gaps that it works better to screw up a piece of sheetrock to cover most of the hole, then patch up the edges. If your crumbling wall is sheetrock, measure the thickness of it so you can buy the same thickness. If it's lathe and plaster, measure the thickness from the surface of the lathe to the surface of the plaster.Also note that joint compound  shrinks when it dries. Its best to apply it to the holes, smoothing with a putty knife, let it completely dry (a day), then do it again (it will have cracked and sunk in spots). Professionals also use joint tape, but this seems overkill since the repair will be hidden behind a baseboard."

Over 20 years experience.www.lowratesappliancerepair.comHOW TO CLEAN AND REPAIR A KITCHEN RANGE HOOD:A range hood that doesn't adequately remove smoke and smells from your kitchen is usually suffering from one of a few common problems: The grease filter or some part of the exhaust ductwork may be clogged, or the fan may be bad. Neither of these repairs should take you much time.Overall Things You'll Need:Plumber's Snake Ammonia Soap Replacement Fan Screwdriver, or nut driver and socket Old Toothbrush Heavy Rag Plastic Pan Unclogging the exhaust system:Instructions: STEP 1: Remove the grease filter by sliding it out of its clips.STEP 2: Submerge the filter in a plastic pan filled with hot, soapy water and 1/2 cup (4 fl oz/125 ml) ammonia. Let it soak for at least 15 minutes. If it's still dirty, soak it again, then rinse it thoroughly and set it aside to dry.STEP 3: Remove the exhaust fan. Unplug the fan, then use a screwdriver or a nut driver and socket to take out the screws that attach it to the hood.STEP 4: Clean the fan blades with an old toothbrush dipped into the ammonia-water mixture (see Warning).STEP 5: Clean the inside of the exhaust ductwork, using a plumber's snake with a heavy rag tied around the end. Push the snake through the ductwork. Soak the rag in the ammonia and water mixture, then run it through the ductwork. Rinse out the rag and repeat the operation until the duct appears to be clean.STEP 6: Clean the exhaust hood that's attached to the outside of your house. Use the old toothbrush and the ammonia-water mixture to loosen the grit and grime around the flapper plate. Make sure the plate moves freely when you're done. If it sticks closed, it can prevent the exhaust hood from working.STEP 7: Reinstall the grease filter. REPLACING THE FAN MOTOR:Instructions: STEP 1: Remove the grease filter by sliding it out of its clips.STEP 2: Turn on the fan and inspect the motor. It needs to be replaced if it hums rather than turns, turns very slowly, runs for a short time then stalls, or feels very hot and won't turn.STEP 3: Disconnect and remove the fan, following step 3, above.STEP 4: Take the fan to an appliance store to get an exact replacement.STEP 5: Install the new fan. OVERALL TIPS AND WARNINGS:Never put a grease filter in your dishwasher to clean it. You could end up with a film of hard-to-remove grease on the dishwasher walls. Clean your grease filter monthly. It's your first line of defense against grease and grime that can damage the fan motor and plug the ductwork. When cleaning the blades on the exhaust fan, take care not to wet the motor. The water could short-circuit the motor when you reinstall it."

4152,76479,how does solar water heaters work? ,"Solar water heaters perform three basic operations before the hot water comes out of your tap:1. Energy Collection: Sunlight is collected and converted to heat energy.The solar collector is mounted on or near your home facing south. As the sunlight passes through the collector’s glazing, it strikes an absorbing material. This material converts the sunlight into heat, and the glazing prevents the heat from escaping in a similar manner to leaving a car parked in the sun with its windows rolled up. The temperature inside a glazed solar collector on your roof can easily reach 150°C when there is no heat transfer fluid flowing through it.The two most common types of solar collectors used in solar water heaters are glazed flat plate and evacuated tube collectors. A glazed flat plate collector consists of a shallow rectangular box with a transparent glass “window” covering a flat black plate. The black plate is attached to a series of parallel tubes or one serpentine tube through which air, water, or other heat transfer fluids pass.An evacuated tube collector consists of several individual glass tubes, each containing a black metal pipe through which the heat transfer fluid passes. The space between the pipe and the glass tube is “evacuated,” so the air is removed.Although uncommon, unglazed plastic collectors can be used as a seasonal solar water heating system. However, they are used mostly for pool heating. Each collector has its advantages, and each can perform well if matched with the proper, well-designed, storage unit.2. Energy Transfer: Circulating fluids transfer the collected energy in the form of heat to a storage tank.Heat energy is transferred from the collector to the water storage tank. In some water heaters, hot fluid is pumped from the collector to the storage tank. The pump is powered by electricity that either comes from an electrical wall outlet or a small photovoltaic module located beside the collector.In other types of solar water heaters, the sun heats the storage tank directly, so the fluid in the collector is heated and rises naturally to a storage tank above the collector. This type of solar water heater is often referred to as a thermosiphon system. It does not  require an electric pump. Passive solar and solar photovoltaic-powered systems will continue to operate even if there is a power outage. The products that require electricity from a wall outlet will not operate during a power outage.3. Energy StorageSolar-heated water is stored in an insulated tank until you need it. Hot water is drawn off the tank when tap water is used, and cold make-up water enters at the bottom of the tank.Solar water heaters tend to have a slightly larger hot water storage capacity than  conventional water heaters. This is because solar heat is available only during the day and sufficient hot water must be collected to meet evening and morning requirements."
4153,59838,how can I reduce hydrocarbons (high and low speed) for a california smog test? ,"If your car failed the ASM California test with elevated HC, it is best to perform proper diagnostics to identify the cause, then repair the cause.Assuming that your car in fuel injected, here is a list of POSSIBLE failures -- 1)  Vacuum leaks2)  Excessive advanced ignition timing3)  A MAP or MAF sensor slightly out of spec. voltage4)  Excessive engine coolant temp5)  EGR valve pintle stuck open6)  Restricted fuel filter7)  Failing fuel pump8)  Failing fuel pressure regulator9)  Sleepy, lazy or otherwise failing oxygen sensor.10) Contaminated engine oil11) PCV valve in need of service.12) Failed or deteriorating catalytic converterThere are many other items, but they are generally related to the above list.It is money saved to take the car to a LICENSED emissions repair and test facility, and ask that they run a diagnostic routine for the elevated hydrocarbons. Take the failure report so that he can look to see what he is chasing.Most shops will perform this task for about an hour's worth of shop time. The repairs will be on top of the diagnostics.One of the things that the tech can do with the report is to calculate the ""LAMBDA"" factor. This will tell him if the engine is in good fuel control or not, and if the primary cause is in the fuel control or if it is in the catalytic converter.If you believe you are being taken advantage of, call the Bureau of Automotive Repair at (800) 952-5210 and ask that they investigate. This is your tax dollars at work. Use them.In the mean time, if you are trying to get the license renewed, pay the fees. It is the State of California, they will take the money! That will stop the penalties at DMV. You won't get a sticker, but you will be paid up. Ask for an extension for driving. This will get you about 90 days more to make the repairs and pass the emissions test, or make the decision to trade the car in for something else.Good Luck"

4158,96638,how do i fix the rear passengers tailight panel to make my tailights and brake light work? ,"What are the symptoms?  You might just need to clean your bulb sockets.  It also depends on whether you have brake lights that operate as turn signals also or if it has completely separate turn signals.  You could just have bad bulbs.  I've seen all the bulbs go bad before anyone noticed!Some common symptoms on systems with brake and turn signals on the same bulbs:Tail light works OK but goes out when brakes are applied. Tail light will blink dimly when turn signal is used.This is a bad ground.  It could be a dirty bulb socket, or a loose ground wire.  The socket can be cleaned with a piece of sandpaper.  The ground wire will be located near the taillight assembly, bolted to the body.This system also runs the turn signals and brake lights through the turn signal switch.  A bad turn signal switch can mess up the brake lights and the turn signals.  The systems that use a separate brake light system have entirely separate circuits for brake, tail, and turn.  These systems typically have amber turn signals and red brake lights.The dirty socket or bad ground stuff still applies.If none of the lights work you probably have a wiring harness that has been damaged."

I used a stud finder and found two areas to drill into to put the supports for the shelves.  I realized afterwards that I was drilling into a wall that has a bathroom on the other side.  I'm paranoid that I might have drilled through the pipe.  There's no sign that anything happened (the drill bit wasn't wet or anything), but I'm still worried.Any tips on 1) figuring out whether I did any damage and 2) preventing me from making a similar mistake in the future?","chances are if you drilled into a pipe, you'd know it immediately. If you're hanging shelves don't you want to mount them to studs? There are a few things to consider: where your hot water heater is, whether or not your house is multi-story, where on the wall you want to drill. Most reputable plumbers, electricians etc use nail plates, a metal protective plate that fits over where pipe or wire passes through a stud to prevent drywallers or subsequent homeowners from damaging their installations. But for future reference, figure that piping will most always run in the most logical route, from where it enters your house to the furthest outlet. Kitchens, bathrooms etc will usually be designed where they share a common wall. In your case, just because there's a bathroom behind the wall you wish to mount your shelves on doesn't mean the piping is within that wall.  Most times, you'll find the shower/bath, sinks and toilet share a common wall, this is because its simpler to run the piping thus saving costs. If the wall you're drilling into is the same wall your bathroom fixtures are on and/or you have 2  or more stories then use a little care..If they're not then don't worry. Homebuilders take into account this ocurrence and take measures to prevent it. Relax."

Remind him/her how expensive the heat costs are.Note this may take a day/two to fix. In the meantime, turn on some fans, or simply open a window (just a crack - periodically) you don't want to LOOSE all your heat.

During the warmer weather I turned it off and now somehow the pilot light got turned out.  I can't seem to get it relit and very cold weather is coming at the end of this week.  I am a single mom with two young boys...help!,"Look for a set of instructions that may appear on one of the panels of the heater.   They may read something like this:  (1) turn the gas dial to ""Pilot"".   While pressing down on the gas dial, press the red push button a few times until the pilot is lit.   (2) KEEP holding down the gas dial for about 30 seconds.  Then release it.  If the pilot light goes out, you probably need to replace your thermocouple (see below).  If it stays let, turn the gas dial to ON.  Otherwise, turn to OFF and leave the whole thing alone for 5 minutes to let any gas disapate.Replaciing a thermocouple....  This is a common home repair. (A common repair for any gas appliance with a standing pilot light.) The thermocouple is a small metal device that makes sure that there is heat where the pilot light is supposed to be. If it doesn't detect heat, it shuts off the gas valve as a safety precaution. When you are holding down the pilot knob during startup, you are essentially bypassing the thermocouple long enough to heat it up. Over time, the thermocouple degrades and dies - killing the pilot light and preventing it from staying on during an attempt to re-light it.You can call an HVAC guy and for about $100+ or so, they will stop by (after another day or two without heat) and replace this part for you. (If you rent, get your land lord to repair it!) Occasionally you will encounter a crook (they are in all lines of work) who will tell you to replace the furnace and will try to charge you $1000s.Want to try this repair yourself? Take a look at the heater and try to determine the length of the thermo-couple. Use the link below to get an idea of what it looks like and how it is connected. They come in different lengths. If you are in doubt you can error on the side of getting one a little too long. I think they are about $10-20 or so at Lowes. Truck yourself down to the hardware store and get one. Turn off the gas to your house if you feel safer (good time to learn how to do this). Usually just need an adjustable wrench at the outside gas meter.Remove the old thermocouple noting where the screws held it in place. Save the screws! You'll likely need them to install the new one. You may not need some of the parts that come with the new one. This is okay. Install the new one by screwing or snapping it into place. Turn gas back on to house. Relight your pilot light following the procedure you did before. Hold down button for at least a minute. This time the pilot light should stay on! Smell for leaks.Paranoid? Install a CO detector near your hot water heater. Keep the wrench handy for house shutoff... but if you have a leak, first get everyone out. Have never leaks and I've replaced several themocouples, furnace igniters, a gas clother dryer, gas cooktop, and even several whole hot water tanks, so take the precautions you want to, but don't be overly paranoid.You may need to re-light pilot lights of other gas appliances having turned off the house gas.This is a fairly common repair, so learning how to do this will save you a few hundred more bucks when it happens again.Good Luck."

4206,1594,how do i remove grout from between tiles? ,"Wow, I just did this last weekend!  If it's floor tile, the easiest way to do it is to use a dremel with a tile bit.  It only took me about an hour to do my whole kitchen floor.  I just had the dremel in one hand and the shop vac in the other and ran the bit down the grout lines and it drilled it all out.  I just set my depth for the bit about 1/4"" let the tile be my guide as I had the bit touching the edge of one tile during the first pass and the edge of the other tile on the way back through that line.  I was worried about it chipping the tile, but it didn't...maybe I got lucky...use at your own risk.  The second way which I started out doing and it took forever was to use a grout saw it's like a screwdriver with a saw blade on the end of it shaped like a blade you put in a utility knife but with teeth and just saw out the grout.  Just start sawing along a tile edge, then saw the edge on the other tile, then break out the grout between the saw lines and suck it all up with the shop vac.  I spent $10 on the grout saw and $8 on the dremel bit (actually made by rotozip but it fits in a dremel) at Home Depot.  If you have a dremel, I'd definately suggest using it for a floor, for a wall I'd CAREFULLY try the dremel bit but probably recommend the saw."

I usually check in the morning before I start the engine. The vehicle must be park and level straight. Modern cars and vehicles have this universal color, I think it is color Orange.

It has the marking below the end of the dipstick either a line, a dotted circle, a punched out small circle, a xxxx that resembles the wooden file. If that falls between the marking (it has to be below the top marking), then the oil is on the right level.If you must checked the engine oil, turn off the engine and wait for 10 minutes. Get a tissue and pull the dipstick out and wipe it. Push the dipstick back all the way, then pull it out and see if the oil is between the markings below the dipstick.If you parked uphill, the oil level shows it's almost empty.If you parked downhill, the oil level shows it's almost full."

There has to be a solution somewhere....a website I overlooked, something.........","If the problem isn't in the areator, I would have to say that it is indeed clogged somewhere between the water line hookups and the faucet's head.  There is a chance that silt has built up inside the actual faucet and is clogged somewhere in there.  You might consider turning off the water to that sink, taking apart the faucet (really simple, email me if you need help) and running some drano through the faucet itself.  Obviously, water is indeed flowing or you wouldn't be able to use the sprayer.  It could also be that you just have a bunk faucet head.  Either way, let me know what it is."
4223,15478,"How do you ground a home? I am looking for details about a ""ufred"" method. Of course that is spelled wrong, but it may sound right,","Older homes often have receptacles and fixtures that are ungrounded, and many local codes do not require that they be rewired so they're grounded. Still, grounding is worth adding to your system because it adds protection against electrical shock. Grounding provides a third path for electricity to travel along, so if there is a leak of any sort, it will flow into the earth rather than into the body of a person who touches a defective fixture, appliance, or tool.An electrical system is grounded with a grounding rod driven at least 8 feet into the ground outside the house or connected to a cold water pipe. Each individual branch circuit must be grounded as well, either with a separate wire that leads to the neutral bar of the service panel or with metal sheathing that runs without a break from each outlet to the panel. (In theory, electrical outlets can be grounded individually, but this is impractical.)"

I was told that the color code is labeled on the car somewhere but I can't find it. Thanks for any info on this.,"Open the drivers side door and look along the edge of the door (the part that concealed when the door is closed which is where the door latching mechanism is). There should be a sticker there which gives the paint code among other things. Keep in mind that the car is  7 years old so a perfect match is not possible. To better match the paint use a very fine grit compound after you let the repainted areas dry for several days, this will help blend the two colors together."

4229,9105,how to drive away the pigeons from my factory shed? they create lot of problem thro their droppings. tried many ways to drive them out. could not sucseed. has any one experienced this. how you are sucessful?,"I understand your frustration.  I love pigeons and have bred them for many years, but wild ones can be a pain. The plastic owls, etc., have a deterrent effect of about two days, then the birds get used to them and perch on them pretty much.  If there is no way that you can physically keep the birds out, then I would suggest another possible idea.  Go to a kite store.  Specialty kite shops often have what I call ""flapping wing bird"" kites. Some of these are designed to look like hawks, gulls, etc.  Get a couple of the hawk ones and post them onto stakes, etc., or from a ceiling, etc., so that they can ""fly""They need to be able to ""fly"" intermittently, either in a natural breeze or perhaps in a fan.  I've suggested this method to a few people in the past and it's seemed to have worked.   The sudden flapping of a ""predator"" spooks the pigeons and if it happens often enough (without any sort of schedule that they can get used to), they usually decide the ""fear"" isn't worth it and go somewhere else.Now having said that, I hope you've also closed off places where they may be nesting, etc., so they don't have any urge to come back again.Good luck -- and at some point when you see others suggesting this and charging for it down the road, remember I said it first :-)"

Other than ""not having a Ford"" or something stupid like that. Serious answers only........ or you are going to Hell!",Even most shop manuals do not cover removing body components such as this. If you want factory information for it you can go to www.motorcraft.com and access the factory manuals for 19.95 for 3 days. Most lamps are secured by either a screw through the lens to the bummper or by vertical screws behind the bumper into the lamp housing. You can raise the car and remove the lower cover panels and reach the lamps from the bottom. If you are still not able to access the lamp screws the bumper is really not hard to remove. There are several pop in clips along the upper and lower edges and at the wheel housing plastic covers then usually 2 bolts that hold the bumper up to the fender on each side. Once you have those out the bumper should slide forward off the car.

Always start there and see what things haven't been tended to in a while.Could be filters, tire pressure, spark plugs, correct warm-up times, etc.  Put some things on your calender when to do next.Next, take extra weight out of the car; some people drive around with at least an extra hundred pounds in the car.Trying for the ""smooth driver award"" is the best way to describe good gas mileage driving, no rapid starts, anticipating stoplights, etc.Leaving just a few minutes early for each trip gives you the option of not speeding, and the added benefit of being a safer driver.  Going faster  really burns lots of gas.Lastly, if you have a fuel injected car, you can turn off your engine for stops of over one minute.These steps can easily take in-town mileage from 15mpg to 20mpg, decreasing gas consumption and gas bills by 25%."

4277,21927,how do I close my swimming pool for the season? ,"You've left out a bit of information, such as inground or above, type of equipment etc. I'll post my generic closing guide here for you.Ideally, your closing starts a week before you actually get down to putting the cover on. Get your water balanced chemically first. That week allows you to do this.On closing day: Vac the pool and drain it to just below the pool returns. They are typically the lowest point in the system. When drained to that point, add in a winterizing chemical kit (most pool shops sell them), they typically contain an algaecide, shock and sequestering agent . Remove ladders and rails. You may remove the diving board if you wish, or cover it in opaque plastic sheet and secure it. If you totally remove it,  place something over the diving board jig bolts and lube those bolts or tape with duct tape that jut up through the deck. This can prevent stubbed toes and saves the jig bolts from corrosion.You're done at the pool for the moment. Head over to your pool equipment. If this is a sand filtered pool, you ought to have done a backwash, during the draining process, to clean out the filter. If a D.E. pool, then the same applies to clean off the elements. You can remove them later for a thorough cleaning. If a cartridge filter, just remove the cartridge and clean at your leisure.For all filter types, there will be a drain plug, remove it and keep it out.Over to the pump. All inground pumps will have 2 plugs, one midway back on one side and one directly in front.All above ground pumps have a single one, located at the front, under the impellor housing. Remove them and place them in the pump basket along with your filter drain plug. It's a nice , safe place, that you won't lose them in, as you'll leave the pump basket right where it is. This next part all depends on your pool plumbing, you'll have to decide the best route as they are all plumbed differently and the many different ways to blow out lines would be a book unto itself. You'll need to tap into both the return and the suction lines. Typically for the returns, you disconnect a line between your filter and heater (if equipped) and for the suction, you can go directly in from the front of the pump, without disconnecting anything. Doing it this way, will allow you to blow all the water out of the heater, pool returns, any waterfall or fountain(if equipped) or attached spa. Same goes for the suction line for skimmer, in wall suction for a pool cleaner and attached spa suctions (if equipped). You can rent a line blower from a rent all or your local pool shop, or you can use a medium sized shop vac that has a blow feature. The shop vac hose is actually the same diameter as the inside diameter of most pool plumbing (1 1/2 inch) so it makes a good fit. Blow out the lines, until you only see a tiny dribble at the pool, both suction and return. Charge the line with plumber's antifreeze (not automotive) and blow that through to the pool, for all lines. When you see the dye colour of the antifreeze at the pool, it means that the antifreeze protection is sufficient. Plug with your telflon taped winter plugs, all lines ending at the pool. Put something squishable (empty chemical containers or an old partially filled inner tube) into the skimmer to protect it from freeze damage. Remove the pressure guages from the filter and put them in the pump basket with your equipment plugs.There are 3 basic types of pool heater, electric, gas and solar. You don't mention which you have, so I'll assume if you do have one, it's gas. Open the drain cocks on both sides of the heater header (you blew out all the water , when doing the lines, should just be a little anti freeze that dribbles out) and disconnect the pressure switch from it's compression fitting. No need to store it, just let it hang from it's electrical wires. Turn off both the gas valve on the interior and the gas feed line going to the heater. Toss a couple"

4279,137704,How can you tell where your car is losing oil when there is no black smoke coming out of exhaust & no leaks? ,"Black smoke is carbon smoke, blue smoke is oil smoke. If you don't see any visible leaks, then it may be blowing it out while under a load or going down the rosd and not smoking when it is sitting still. Try either having someone follow you to see if it smokes or drive it a little hard and stop and get out and look right away to see if it is smoking. It could also be a valve cover leaking and it dripping on the exast manifold and burning it off instead of dripping on the ground and that may be why you are not seeing any leaks on the ground."

4286,21049,How do I match fence design with my home and landscape styles? ,"No disrespect, but next time give more info: year your house was built, your landscape style that you mentioned but we have no idea what style it is.My house was built in 1906 and I chose a picket fence of my own unique design around the front yard; have 6' privacy fence of cedar around backyard ~ and nine different style gates that I have fun with, decorating and painting.Split-rail fences look especially good with ranch style houses and 1950-1960s houses.  Then again, I like them just about anywhere.  Picket fences date back to Victorian era, but widely used on just about any style house.  There's a saying:  If you want the fence to show, paint it white; If you want the garden to show, don't paint the fence.

I am NOT handy and either is my husband, so explain in the simplest of terms :)","The way you describe it, I assume you took two very long lengths of chain and tried to throw them over the tree limb, and ending up with 2 hanging lengths of chain on each side of your swing. This is more difficult to get to swing because as you try to swing, one side of the chain fights with the other side. What you need to do is loop the chain over the limb, then you need to attach the end of the chain to a link iin the chainup by the limb, so that a single strand of chain hangs down to your swing. This arrangement would give you 2 strands of chain total hanging from the limb, one for each side of the swing. It should work fine like this."

I'm not sure what they charge otherwise. When I had them there wasn't much of a body count to be honest and the guy from pest control said that's normal enough cos they take the poison back to their nest and they all die there. Are you sure they are still alive? I'd carry on putting the poison down cos they are taking it and it will eventually kill them. Traps are useful too. Or even get a cat or dog - tho that's a bit drastic if you don't want a pet! Good luck I know how horrible it is but they will die in the end. Carry on doing what you're doing. The poison works on a body weight for weight basis so if there are quite a few of them it will take a while to kill them all off."

That way the waxed paper wouldn't stick to the plaster.  The usual method of repairing a hole in plaster board is to put a support piece behind the wallboard rather than try to get mud to hang in a hole that size and support it from the front.

If you remove the head to replace the gasket (which you have to do anyway) you will know if the head (or block for that matter) is cracked.

The down lights are small with two prongs pointing towards the roof when installed,but I cannot get the old one out,any ideas would be appreciated,thanks for your help.","The halogen is made such that the actual lamp is inside the surrounding reflector. The lamp has two prongs portruding from the reflector that fit tightly into a ""free"" base, in that the base is not really secured to anything other than the lamp, and the lamp is typically held by the trim. This is a little different than landscape lighting where the base us usually secured to a  mount.Let them completely cool off, get the lamp out of the trim piece then work one side of the base up a little (nearest one of the two pins), then the opposite side, ""wiggling"" the lamp slowly out of the base. If it absolutely does not move, the flimsy little base may get bent up trying to force everything, these are easy to replace if they get totally wrecked and you can buy them at any electrical supply house. Once in awhile one or both of the pins break off in the hole, a good pair of needle nose pliers may get them out.If you end up replacing the base, use high temperature rated wire nuts to attach the new leads to the old leads. Make sure you do not use lamps with a wattage greater then the fixture is rated for, often 50 watts. There are soome 70 watt maximum and there are some trim pieces that will force a maximum of 35 watts, such as shower trims. Too high a wattage may damage fixtures and/or cause fires."
4311,65707,How do I know how much air to put in car tires? I'm rather new at cars and my car tires are sagging. I don't quite know how much air I should put in them with a standard gas station air pump.,"Wow, so many answers, so few correct.  It amazes me that so few people actually know how much air to put in there tires.  No disrespect to you, you are just asking the question.  The psi marked on the side of your tire is the max inflation that tire is rated at.  It should say something like ""35 psi at 1300 lbs"".  What this means is if your car weighs  5200 lbs you should run 35 psi according to the tire manufacturers specs.  If your car weighs 3500 lbs, 35 psi is to much to run.  There is actually a formula to use to calculate the proper inflation pressure if you are that critical about it.  My assumption is that you are not, you just want to know how much air to put in your tires.  If you check the id tag in your door jamb it will tell you how much your car weighs and how much air to put in the tires.  The only problem I have with this is that car manufactures tend to go on the low side with this because it gives you a smoother ride and may tend to prematurely wear out the tires but if it helps them sell cars they will tell you whatever they want.  It has already been said at least once, if you are just not sure, run them at 32 psi.  If you have a standard run of the mill car (any mid size or compact) this will be fine no matter what size tires you have.  I have a one ton truck with 10 ply tires on it, on the side of the tires it says ""max inflation 80 psi at xxxx lbs"".  (1800 or something)  Do I run 80 psi?  Heck no, I run them at 40 all day long.  If I am hauling a big load I jack them up to whatever I need to to handle the load.  I have a Durango with 31/10.50/15 6 ply's.  They say 50 psi max, I run them at 30, 35 if I am going on a long trip with luggage and such.  I have  a 70 Bug with 165/15's, I run them at 32 all the time.  I run my tire pressures according to my driving habits and comfort.  My Durango has some aftermarket suspension mods that already make it ride like a caddy so the softer tires make it even nicer.  I drive my bug pretty fast and where I live there are a lot of twisty roads and the higher pressure helps with the cornering and squeezes every bit of mileage out of the fuel.  The reason I tell you all of this is so you can see just how ""uncritical"" it really is.  Oh yeah, about the over inflation.  Your tires are most likely radials, they do look a little low on air all of the time, that is they way they are designed.  In the old days whey bias tires were the norm overinflation was a bad thing because of heat buildup.  You could actually blow a tire if it had to much air in it.  In radials that is pretty much out the window.  On average even on a hot day on hot asphalt you will gain only about 2-3 psi in your tires.  Not enough to worry about.  If your tires are overinflated by 5 psi it won't really hurt anything so don't lose sleep over it.  That is what radials are all about, they hold their form, they are made out of steel not nylon.  The two best pieces of advice I could give you would be this: always keep your tires evenly inflated and rotate them every 5000 miles.  I hope this lengthy answer has been helpful, I tried to be as informative as I possibly could without being too confusing."
